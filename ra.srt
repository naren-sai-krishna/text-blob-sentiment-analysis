00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,580
Get out first

23
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,250
Give the torch.

24
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
do CPR

25
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,370
Come on..take taht fast.

26
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,540

Breathe

31
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:18,870
Breathe

32
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,830
Come on...Breathe

33
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,660
Prepare for eternal injection

34
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,910
(FEW MONTHS BEFORE)

35
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,290
Black Cobra,

36
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,200
it would be around 3 feet long

37
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,120
That will have a scar of fighting with the Mangoose on it's waist

38
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
It bit me four days back

39
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,950
I am saved because of the witch man Subbadu at village

40
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,830
I am now searching for it

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,830
I will not leave it, I will kill that

42
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,830
This is its skin shed.
The skin is here means it would not have gone far

43
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,330
That would be caught

44
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,870
No idea why but I keep finding something as
and when I search for this snake

45
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,080
My name is Chittibabu.
I am the Engineer for this village

46
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,040
All look at the sky when their crops need
water in any village,

47
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,120
but they look at me in our village

48
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,620
What Chittibabu, when would you put water to my crops?

49
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,910
I told you that I will put the day after right?

50
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,200
That old fellow is too much in a hurry

51
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,330
What Chittibabu?
Why did you water my fields just half and left?

52
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,200
Only half would get wet when you pay only half the money

53
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,330
Hey Chittibabu, see and walk

54
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,660
What rascal? Why does everyone scream..?

55
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,910
Can you not speak normally?
Do you not know to talk slowly?

56
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,120
If someone screams again, he will get wet in pants

57
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,950
Not that dude
I will hit with the pipe

58
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,160
Say slowly now

59
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,620
Not that dude, they are cutting the
tree there and walk carefully

60
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,290
Yes, you should say like this

61
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,620
I should water to your half acre right? Ok, I will

62
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,750
Not just you but will water his, his and even his.

63
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,620
I will not leave anyone

64
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,450
Hey Chittibabu
Hey Chittibabu, stop

65
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,750
Why are you screaming again?

66
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,410
Who else will come for you?

67
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,750
If not me, you think Goddess Ganges
comes from the sky and water?

68
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,830
Chittibabu, come this side

69
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,370
Oh no
Hey

70
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,910
You now understood why they are screaming so loud right?

71
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,540
Because I cannot hear until someone screams aloud

72
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,950
This is our engine problem

73
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,200
Thus all in village say us Engineer, no...

74
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,290
call me sound engineer

75
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,410
Whatever but this deficiency is a boon to me

76
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,290
Hey chittibabu..
See him asking loud to pay back the money.

77
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,660
I heard it but I did not listen to that

78
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,830
That means I listen to some sounds and some are seen

79
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,410
Deaf rascal

80
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,950
Look, he is leaving saying something
and that was seen to me

81
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,410
Hey Errababu

82
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,830
Come back for once

83
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:33,910
What..?

84
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,370
You said something just passing over?

85
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,160
What did I say Chittibabu?I did not say anything Chittibabu
What did you say?

86
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,950
You said something. Your lips gave a movement.

87
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,580
Say what?

88
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,870
Oh that?
I just asked is the chutney fine?

89
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,700
No dude, you said something else
What did I say?

90
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,830
idiot...say so

91
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,080
Idiot

92
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,250
No sound

93
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,750
Idiot

94
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,580
Not that Errababu ...That should be a bit more lengthy

95
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,620
Oh no...

96
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,080
Dirty rascal

97
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,120
Dirty rascal

98
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,700
Errababu, both the lips haven't met

99
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,040
What would that be?

100
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,620
Deaf rascal,... say so

101
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,450
He is got it

102
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,290
Say
No

103
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,120
Say... deaf rascal

104
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,750
deaf rascal

105
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,120
Deaf rascal... You said the same, yes

106
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,660
I've arranged for a desciple too to say
if anything is missed out

107
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,160
Mahesh, what is the news?

108
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,700
Play the cassette

109
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,000
We started with engine early in the morning right?

110
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,450
Papayamma came opposite in the
way showering the dung water

111
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,330
She asked in love, hey Chittibabu will you eat the cheese?

112
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,160
Why will she not ask?
I've given 10 rupees discount too for the engine

113
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,830
She should ask

114
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,750
Then Rangamma Aunty on the river shore shouted loud
and you may have heard that

115
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,500
Yes, only Rangamma aunt speaks so
loud in the entire village like I can hear.

116
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,410
Even this engine belongs to aunt.

117
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,750
Her voice is loud but heart is soft.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,410
She helps anyone in need from this village.

119
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,080
Be cool Rangamma, you too will have kids

120
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,450
Yes, it is true for my hubby to return from Dubai
and true that I will have kids

121
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,500
Here is 20 rupees.

122
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,870
Hey Rangamma aunt!

123
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,080
If you don't return by the coming festival, I'm not any good lady
Hey, Rangamma Aunty..

124
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,620
Hey..wait.

125
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,500
and will ask before all in the street

126
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Aunty, see what I got?

127
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,040
Good watch, take this and give a hundred

128
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,370
Here..take

129
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,410
Thanks.

130
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes, how is it? It looks great on uncle.

131
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,950
It looks good for you.

132
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:31,950
What..?

133
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,750
I am saying it looks good for you

134
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,200
What..? Okay.

135
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,580
Here, your hundred

136
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,540
Keep it dear
My darling

137
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,830
I did not say our village name, right?

138
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,250
Rangasthalam!

139
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,250
The real story just starts

140
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:05,250
(Village Traditional Song)

141
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,040
What Narsamma,
looks like you have a bumper crop this year...

142
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,700
You cannot be controlled now

143
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,330
What do we have brother,
it is all the result of hard work from my son

144
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,830
He worked very hard day
and night to somehow get his sister married

145
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,870
He is my maternal son in law right?

146
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,830
It is all about your marriage
Come on brother

147
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,370
Here is the advance 3000,
I will give total payment when we sell all the bags

148
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,370
When would you give?

149
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,410
Come on,I'm saying will return right?

150
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:05,160
We hereby inform to everyone that as Bollam Narasamma
did not repay the loan taken from society,

151
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,080
the crops from this land belongs to the society

152
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,750
None should either cut the crop or work in this

153
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,620
If does so,

154
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,330
Why are you announcing so,
your loan is repaid long back right?

155
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,580
Oh no..no.. public are not having any proper thinking

156
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,950
What, have you dreamt that your loan is over so fast?

157
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,290
The money you gave was enough for the compounded
interest and the Principal is still remaining

158
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,200
What do we know about those entire accounts sir?

159
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,450
As you did not ask, we thought loan is completely cleared

160
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,870
We have been repaying the loan with all
we got from crops from the past six years

161
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,540
and we do not understand
why the loan is not yet cleared sir

162
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,000
What can I do man,

163
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,580
I am the society President.

164
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,160
You shout if I collect and he would shout if I do not

165
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,450
See how the officer is sitting in the Jeep
like a swollen potato

166
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,620
What man, how much pay did you give?

167
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,700
You would give 10 rupees less per
one bag as you are giving cash

168
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,910
I'm paying 100 rupees per sack sir

169
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,080
Pay the balance in the society and take the seed bags

170
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,200
Sir, I have planned to get my daughter married this year sir.

171
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,160
I cannot do it after this year, you show mercy sir

172
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,910
Are men any less in the village?

173
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,750
Give another chance to people like me whose wife is dead

174
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,160
Hey..

175
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,500
Oh no...

176
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,620
Brother...

177
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,910
Don't cry

178
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,080
Namaste sir.

179
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,290
Sir, it is all over. My son is dead sir.

180
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,080
He is gone leaving me

181
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,250
Why do you cry?

182
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,660
What do we do when there is a tree full of fruits?
We see the ripe fruit, cut it and eat

183
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,830
Even the God is like us,
he sees for the correct guy and takes him

184
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,950
Ok, think his life time is over.

185
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,290
Here, look into the works to happen

186
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,870
Sir...

187
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,910
Sir...

188
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,830
He is the President of our village.

189
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,950
He is being elected unanimously from 30 years

190
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,700
There is none even filing nominations against him

191
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,540
In Rangasthalam there is only one party and one flag.

192
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,120
What he says is the judgment and what he makes is the law

193
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,330
Not just before him but none dares to
walk with slippers in front of his house

194
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,830
He is very crazy about radio

195
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,870
He is a great devotee. He is into worships year long

196
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,120
Few believe because of that he has some powers
and something bad happens opposing him

197
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,160
Elections have come again in our village

198
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,080
His is the only nomination as the President even this time

199
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,450
Hail to the President sir

200
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,000
It is like a celebration in the village if he is filing nomination

201
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,450
Ranga..Ranga.. In Rangasthalam...

202
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,540
Ranga..Ranga.. In Rangasthalam...

203
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,330
Not like one listens but hit like all see

204
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:08,290
Ranga...Ranga...In Rangasthalam we are all toys and
puppets though we have do not put any color or makeup

205
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,830
We are all toys and puppets

206
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:24,330
In Rangasthalam we are all toys and puppets
who cannot stop once the game starts

207
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,450
We are all toys and puppets

208
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:35,000
We are the toys being played by an invisible hand

209
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,040
We are the puppets dancing to an unheard song

210
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,370
Ganga is the wife Lord Siva
and the air is the father of Hanuman

211
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:49,040
Either to breathe air or to wet the throat,
they should show mercy

212
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,000
Flute is the instrument of Lord Krishna,
Triceps is the weapon of Goddess Kali

213
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,540
Either to sing a song or to attack with weapon,
it happens only when they permit

214
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:10,660
Ranga...Ranga...In Rangasthalam we are all toys and
puppets though we have do not put any color or makeup

215
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,870
We are all toys and puppets

216
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,750
It is Ravana having ten heads and
Lord Rama has not even a single bad thought

217
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:52,080
They kept Rama and Ravana and played the game of
Ramayana and put us in between good and bad

218
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,410
The one who cannot put aside morals is Dharmaraju
and the one with no mercy is Yamadharma

219
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,040
That attack is a must not walking in his path,
saying so they are running our life like a play

220
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:13,200
In Rangasthalam we are all toys and puppets
who cannot practice before playing

221
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,410
We are all toys and puppets

222
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,870
What Chittibabu sir, is your brother coming?

223
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,500
Yes, he is coming after one year
Oh, is it?

224
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,080
Give tat guava here

225
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,200
Then you sat turning this side
and how will you know when the bus arrives?

226
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,290
Will you sit here if the bus comes?
Will you not start shouting with basket over head?

227
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,700
Oh no...bus has come sir..
Guava...guava...

228
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,040
Guava...guava... 4 for 25 paisa...

229
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,160
Here..

230
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,410
Hey Chitti, are you fine?

231
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,910
How are all at home?

232
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,830
Is sister fine?

233
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,500
Hey Chitti

234
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,910
Hey Chitti

235
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,620
What Chitti, why are you going without talking?

236
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,080
I and he had a small fight before leaving to Dubai.

237
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,200
He scolded me for wearing his shirt
and since then I have no talks with him

238
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,290
Hey Chitti, I am asking you.

239
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,500
How are all at home?

240
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,500
Hey..I am talking to you.

241
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,040
Is your anger still not down?

242
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,750
Hey, sorry dude

243
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,500
See, he is still not saying sorry even
after so long that he is come

244
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,290
He is very egoistic

245
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,950
Hey..Sorry.

246
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,040
I said sorry right? Talk now

247
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,040
What, I did not understand

248
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,870
What you said is also the same for me

249
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,410
When would that dumb head understand?

250
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,000
Hey Chitti, sorry dude

251
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,000
He said it now

252
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,500
Are you fine Brother..?
What did you bring from Dubai?

253
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,580
Hey...

254
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,580
Hey...

255
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,250
As Rongali Chandramma did not repay the
loan taken, her house is seized

256
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,700
Leave this time sir, do not put such
blames on my daughter in law

257
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,950
Then agree that your son has come
and I will agree that your daughter in law is pure

258
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,000
Come on agree

259
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,080
What is that with that old lady?

260
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,200
Hey Kumar, when did you come from Dubai

261
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,500
I just came, what is the matter?

262
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,500
Nothing dude, it is been three years
since her son left for Koita

263
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,450
and she has an year old kid in her lap

264
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,290
She says her daughter in law is pure

265
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,330
Not understanding how did that kid come dear

266
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,330
You do not talk wrong
Her son had come last year for the festival and I know it

267
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:53,290
Yes my dear, that fellow came for festival
had nice food and left without repaying the debt

268
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,540
Will her father repay the debt?

269
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,040
Hey, push them out and lock the house

270
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,000
Hey... Hey...
How much is it?

271
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,950
Our society is very kind,
if you pay the interest for now, we shall leave.

272
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,040
Pay one thousand

273
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,410
Give Chittin, come on I am saying to give

274
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,000
There maybe people without food in the village
but none without a debt

275
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,000
Hey..
Go

276
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,160
Hey Chinababu
Yes

277
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,080
Go inside...

278
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,700
Mom, brother has come

279
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,750
What son, was the journey good?

280
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,910
Hey be right there, be right there,

281
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,160
Are you fine mom?

282
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,830
Mother in law, put some red chili more,
I think my evil sight may hit

283
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,950
Not one or two chilli but a sack of chilies are required, go

284
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,830
Enough son..

285
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,120
Daddy, have you visited the eye Doctor

286
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,330
Yes, I showed son

287
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,700
He says not to operate machine in the nights
and how is it possible for us?

288
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,620
Wash the feet

289
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,580
Brother...
When did you come brother?

290
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,290
Just now dear

291
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,250
Are you studying well?
Yes! What did you bring for me?

292
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,410
For you?

293
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,910
Brother that Jyothy bought cycle long back.

294
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,700
Buy for me too brother

295
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,120
Enough idiot, you are torturing from when he came

296
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,500
Why are all shouting mom?

297
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,700
It is become a habit always shouting to him, son

298
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,700
Nothing, I am saying you are running this whole family

299
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,200
Yes, I am dying to do both Engine work
and the household work

300
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,790
Hey, what did you get for me?

301
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,370
Chitti, I forgot. I will bring the next time when I come

302
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,000
You...
Come, eat

303
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,700
Go to the house Venkatsamy
and bring Cheese Milk saying brother has come

304
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,700
Go, I will not bring

305
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,750
Feed him more, feed the cheese, sweet rice and everything

306
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,620
What is he thin, he is like a pig
Go and bring son

307
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,000
I should bring but he never brings anything for me
Brother

308
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,000
Wow, whose are these goggles?

309
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,410
What brother, you never forget me

310
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,830
See now, this whole Rangasthalam now...

311
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,450
What, it became dark bro?

312
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,790
Hey brother
Yes

313
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,290
Is it so necessary to go to town so late in the night

314
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,000
It is been very long since I saw Padma
and thought to visit her once

315
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,250
What will you do after seeing?
Will you hug her tight?

316
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,290
Hey, she is your to be sister in law
You will go blind idiot

317
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,080
I put these goggle not to lose the eyes

318
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,950
I cannot see whatever you do now.
What did you say..?

319
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,750
Hey you...
Hey, stop bro

320
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,790

00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,500
Padma...
Kumar, come here

325
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,620
How are you Padma?

326
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,910
Oh! is it..

327
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,950

328
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,910
Oh, you remember to bring gift for girlfriend

00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,700
Oh no, I am able to see

330
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,160
He doesn't look normal

331
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,040
( Songs palying in Radio)

332
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,080
Manoranjani, you heard songs you requested for.
The time now is...

333
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,200
Oh no, it is time for my warden to come

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,040

338
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,830
Why is sister in law crying bro?

339
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,830
Is love so dude?
Will you feel like crying?

340
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,910
Hello President sir

I have brought the papers for those
40 houses as you said sir

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:34,000
I even got the bullock cart on subsidy for your
ward member Rangaswamy

345
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,870
What about the road to that leads to the fields ?

346
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,040
I have got the concrete road from
that tree to our fields sanctioned Sir

347
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,750
Have it Sir

348

Call that Contractor Nagaraju

349
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:45,950
Sir

350
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,160
Loan is sanctioned even to those Dimpa's
and cattle farmers and they are signing

351
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,410
Here, keep it here

352
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,330
If you give away these DDs with your hands to them...

353
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,410
Tea gets cold, have it

354
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,950
Sir, these DDs

355
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,790
President Sir knows what the public need.

356
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,410
Convert those DDs to cash and hand it over to the clerk

357
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:13,910
Sir...

358
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,040
Yes, we understood

359
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,200
Here, take your bribe and leave now

360
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,700
Greetings...

361
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,330
Sir, who would clean the glass?

362
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,870
You maybe the adopted son to Government
but not for Rangasthalam

363
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,120
What is this, am I any beggar?

364
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,500
I am an officer

365
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,950
Will the systems not change here?

366
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,700
I do not understand what is happening here

367
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,580
We have no idea where the bonds,
loans and subsidies coming for you are disappearing

368
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,870
Who can we ask?

369
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,750
He is the President from 30 years.

370
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,000
We can do something only when the power changes

371
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,950
Damn you! Hey, open your eyes at least now

372
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,950
At least one of you compete in these elections

373
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,120
What will he do?

374
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,290
Will he kill? That is it right? To hell with these dirty lives

375
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,580
I cannot change you guys

376
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,790
What's wrong with him brother?

377
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,080
Taililor Koteswarrao's son sir,
looks like he's brought something for you

378
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,200
Hello sir...

379
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,580
Hey, stop your nuisance and kill that snake first.

380
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,540
It is eating up my chicks

381
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,700
Move, what are you seeing guys?

382
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,870
Snake

383
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,540
You should not see the snake for so long, you should hit

384
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,410
Hit then

385
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,200
Today is Thursday so I will not hit, you hit

386
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,750
I had recently poured milk in the mound and prayed.
I will not hit, you hit dude

387
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,370
Don't you know, your sister is pregnant
so I should not do sinful things

388
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,370
You hit dude

389
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:02,410
I understood... Chittibabu...

390
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,160
Chittibabu, your snake is come here...
Where?

391
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,500
Is it roaming in the village too these days?
Where did you go..?

392
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,500
Dirty rascal, don't you have a common sense?

393
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,830
Will you peep in when a girl is taking bath?
Have you gone blind?

394
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,500
You came into my bathroom,
you dirty idiot...you dirty idiot.

395
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,750
Why are you seeing with open mouth, you dirty idiot?

396
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,790
let your mother's stomach burn...
Let someone put mud in your mouth.

397
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,160
Why are you staring so like an owl rascal?
I will pluck out your eyes

398
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,500
You..bloody Idiot..

399
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,540
You are gone high in cholesterol, are you gone deaf rascal?

400
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,620
To hell with you idiot,
what work do you have in the ladies bathroom?

401
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,040
Is it not enough of what you saw, get out from here rascal

402
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:16,540
You are so beautiful like a treasure, found
while actually digging the mud for groundnut

00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:54,790
You are so beautiful like a treasure, found

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,200
You are a two legged rain drop

You showed the sweetness to the sugarcane crop,
how cute you are..

420
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,040
Like the smile of the mom coming
opposite to her crying missing kid

421
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,830
You are so cute Lachimi, you are so cute

422

Oh no, son come here.

426
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,500
He is unable to here even after shouting so loud

427
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,120
Hey Chitti

428
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,080
He used to hear when I say loud
and now even that is gone

429
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,500
Hey, ears will be gone

430
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,000
Why is he honking so loud?

431
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,620
Chitti, you are able to listen right?

432
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,250
What dude, I am able to listen even
when you are talking so low?

433
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,870
Machine bro, Doctor has given a machine to you

00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:48,370
You are so cute when you walk with
the bundle of sticks on the head

443
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,450
and it appears like you are carrying the forest on your head

444
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,330
You are so cute Lachimi

445
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:01,450

00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,250
You are so cute Lachimi

451
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,750
What beauty...What beauty...?

452
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,790
That girl is just the same as how you looked
when you attained puberty

453
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,120
What, when did you see
when I attained puberty and became an adult

454
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,830
The whole street was crowded with youngsters... Believe me.

455
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,620
You uncle used to feel jealous

456
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,830
I am saying, your uncle used to feel jealous

457
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,870
You too will feel jealous seeing that girl

458
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,000
what scoldings..what scoldings ? When she was
scolding, they dashed like bullets into my ears

459
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,160
Still, we must agree. She is a great beauty

460
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,910
Hey aunty

461
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,870
Look, are you Chittibabu?

462
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,500
Are you Chittibabu?

463
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,040
Oh no, looks like I'll be ruined

464
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,700
Aunty, can you come in for once?
What is this, hey...

465
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,830
Leave my hand dude, my husband is in Dubai...
Hey..not that.

466
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:24,040
This is the girl I saw while bathing and
now she is come and started scolding

467
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,620
Hey, she is not scolding but is asking are you Chittibabu?

468
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,200
Is it?

469
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,700
Yes, see now

470
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
There are four Chittibabus in the village

471
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:44,870
Rongali Chittibabu, Sana Chittibabu,
Engineer Chittibabu and Deaf Chittibabu

472
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,160
Remember Engineer Chittibabu,

473
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,580
which is me and I answer only when called to as Engineer

474
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,330
Oh, I too studied till sixth class

475
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,830
We have to water our fields, are you free day after?

476
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:58,910
Tomorrow?

477
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,000
No chance if it is tomorrow
and I will think about if it is day after

478
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,250
What is it aunty, we got to go to the
sugarcane fields of Venkatrao tomorrow

479
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,700
Aunty, let me say about myself

480
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,250
You idiot, that girl too has asked
for day after and not tomorrow

481
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,450
I understood for watering the fields and the rest...

482
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,700
See, I will cover it up

483
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,370
I just said right?
It is not possible for tomorrow and ok for the day after

484
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,250
How much would that cost? Is it per hour or per acre?

485
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:37,000
Again....aunty what is she saying?
Hey stop

486
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,410
What is your romance, closing the door every time?
What is happening here?

487
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,370
Look girl, there would be so much of secrecy in a business.

488
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,290
You are daughter of that drunkard right?

489
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,200
Talking like it is some 30 acres, you have just 3 acres

490
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,160
Our Chittibabu will water it by evening starting
the engine in the morning, what do you think?

491
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,910
What dude?

492
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,040

493
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,200
Let us see how great a man is your
guy after starting the engine.

494
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,910
Say the cost first.
Wait...

495
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,910
Engine is mine and the oil is yours.

496
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,290
50 Rupees per hour and 20 Rupees charges,
lunch in the noon and a bundle of cigars in between

497
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,330

499
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,950
Wait...

You are so cute dear...

502
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,750
Hey, what time shall I come on the day after?

503
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,790
Hey Mahesh

00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,540
Come here, Ramalakshmi is coming.
What shall I do?

505
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,620
What if she talks while putting the oil?

506
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,330
Yes, correct

507
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,330
Do one thing, you be in worship and I will do..

508
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,120
Can I believe?

509
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,410
I promise on the snake that bit you sir

510
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,000
Hey, talk low. Put that leg here

511
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,000
Hello Ramalakshmi madam.

514
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Look I am putting three liters
He cannot listen, madam.

515
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,410
I mean, he never listens to anything while in worship.
Say after it is done

516
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,950
You are so cute.. You are so cute Lachimi

517
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,700
Oh no..

00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,370
Hey Mahesh

519
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,040
Babe is so hot right?

520
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,830
You should know about all that, do not pull me into that

521
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,250
She is coming..

522
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,160
You messed unnecessarily.
She is coming now and what will you answer?

523
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,410
Whether my boss is great or not would be known now.

524
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,450
Hey

525
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:11,910
What?

526
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,700
What are you seeing?

527
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,910
What is that look?

528
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,160
Look, I cannot hear in the engine sound.

529
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,080
Talk loud

530
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,450
Wow boss, you managed great

531
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,790
Is what you saw the day before not enough?

532
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,160
Past is past and today is fresh again.

533
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,410
do we not have dinner because we had lunch?

534
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,120
True boss, hunger is fresh when ever one is hungry

535
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,950
I see

536
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,080
Learned dog has said disco when ever some one said isko

537
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,160
What, I cannot listen

538
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,500
Do you have no shame to talk so?

539
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,450
Which caste are you from?

540
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,250
Our engine will have no caste and religion

541
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,080
It wets any land

542
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,250
This land will never go dry now

543
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,700
Still, Rangamma aunt said that
your father is in law to me as a relative

544
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,620
Imagine what are you for me in that relation?

545
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,790
What is your relation to Rangamma aunt?

546
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,200
Engine sound, talk louder and I cannot hear

547
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,000
You...

548
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,250
Hey...
Move

549
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,750
Why do you stop the engine, wait...
What are you thinking about me..?

550
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,790
He is finished now
Hey Mahesh... Mahesh...

551
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,620
What's your matter?

552
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,950
What are those talks between you
and your aunt Rangamma closing the door?

553
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,580
What are you talking?

554
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,700
You are talking about seeing me while bathing right?

555
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,700
Hey Chittibabu

556
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,910
I am seeing
Rangamma aunty

557
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,700
Leave that engine to him
and go collect the debt from Venkat.

558
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,000
Tomorrow is the festival and he cannot be caught tomorrow
Yes, I am coming right away

559
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,040
Look here, do you think I have only engine works?
I have so many other works

560
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,790
I am observing every thing. when ever I get a chance to
catch you I will cut you and sprinkle chili over your body

561
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,410
Hey, I am unable to see. Cover with sari

562
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,830
You, rascal

563
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,830
How is my new shirt dude?

564
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,370
It is a wow, only you are visible allover

565
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,620
Chittibabu, money
I will say in the night and pay in the morning...

566
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,700
Sir, Ramalakshmi
I saw dude

567
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,750
She looks so beautiful..I will meet her and will come again

568
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,330
Boss, why are you messing unnecessarily?

569
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,040
You cannot listen and get booked just like that

570
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,500
Ramalakshmi should give us the engine money

571
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,950
I will ask Ramalakshmi engine money
and she says Chittibabu, here is the money and finished

572
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,540
You are finished

573
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,700
Ramalakshmi, my engine payment

574
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,290
Why, you think I would run away without paying or what?

575
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,830
I am moving around keeping
it in my waist from day before to pay that

576
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,830
How much is it in total?

577
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,620
You came an hour late in the morning
and slept an hour in the noon after food

578
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,500
Hey Mahesh...

579
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,250
You went somewhere for an hour on the
work of that Rangamma

580
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,290
Are you done now?

581
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,830
One more hour in the middle saying engine got heated up

582
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,580
Taking out those hours and reducing the advance 50,
what is the final amount?

583
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,000
What you will know, I should only say as I studied sixth class

584
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,700
It would account to 80 in total.

585
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,580
Here, take this 100 and give my 20 rupees back

586
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,950
When I said to pay back 20 taking 100,
why are you pinching?

587
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,910
Oh, say like that then..

588
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,700
I should take 100 and give 20 back, right?

589
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,250
Huh, I have no change and will give it tomorrow

590
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,200
Hey Chittibabu... Chittibabu...

591
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,410
If you take all the money, what shall I buy with?

592
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,080
I have no money and buy at least bangles for me

593
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,620
Why are you pinching again
when I asked to buy me bangles?

594
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,410
Bangles right, I will buy. Come on

595
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,040
Mud bangles, plastic bangles and Singapore bangles...

596
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,290
Hello.. Show bangles for our ladies

597
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,830
These will correctly match for you

598
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,290
How much?

599
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,080
Dozen 10 rupees
Oh, that is it?

600
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,950
Shall I get into your bullock cart?
You bloody idiot.

601
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,120
How much?

602
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,450
Those are Singapore bangles and costly.
They are 40 per dozen

603
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,370
Hello, I will buy these.

604
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,410
No...

605
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,790
These are enough

606
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,250
He is messing too much with Ramalakshmi

607
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,370
Sound is great

608
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,290
Come on dude, let us mess it up
You say so?

609
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:45,910
Move on

610
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,290
They would look good for you, wear them.

611
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,330
Look, take 40 and give 60 back.

612
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,250
I never step back at ladies

613
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,950
What Chittibabu, new shirt?

614
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:57,870
Yes dude

615
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,540
My brother brought from Dubai and my father stitched it.

616
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,250
Is it good?

617
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,080
What just good dude? When the babe is so hot,

618
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,410
I think you are eating daily

619
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,080
What bro?
It is thus great

620
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,450
Yes dude, Singapore bangles and forty rupees

621
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,830
Ramalakshmi, bangles are great

622
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,080
She fell for bangles only means maybe
she would come for family life if one gives anklets

623
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:16,750
Come..

624
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,290
Shirt is great Chittibabu

625
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,330
What dear, what happened?

626
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,290
Ramalakshmi... Hey Ramalakshmi...

627
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,330
Oh..! what happened to her?

628
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,330
Why are you like that Sir?

629
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,330
Why did Ramalakshmi leave angry?

630
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,830
I doubt brothers of that Kasi said something

631
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,580
Is it boss?

632
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,870
No problem if they said nothing.

633
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,750
But I would be an idiot if they had said something

634
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,700
What to do now then sir?

635
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,950
Either they said or not, let us bash them up.

636
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,040
It would be good

637
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,580
Will you have the snacks?

638
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,790
Say what did they say about my Ramalakshmi?

639
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,160
Chittibabu, sorry. It was a mistake

640
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,200
You said mistake means you spoke something bad.

641
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,500
You speak bad rascals...

642
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,750
You speak bad

643
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,700
Hey Chittibabu, why are you hitting my brothers?

644
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,620
He said something to Ramalakshmi

645
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,830
Hey stop...
Chitti

646
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,120
Stop bro, what happened?

647
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,950
Brother, they spoke something wrong to Ramalakshmi

648
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,290
Hey...stop.

649
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,700
What did they talk wrong? Say what did you say guys?

650
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,000
Look, if my brothers said something bad I will hit them

651
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,040
If they did not, will you hit your brother?

652
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,700
Chitti, what did they say?

653
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,830
Say dude, what are you thinking?

654
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:38,870
What happened, Chitti?

655
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,160
These guys to Ramalakshmi...
To Ramalakshmi...

656
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,750
Ramalakshmi... That is...

657
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,620
They said something about my Ramalakshmi
What can he say? He cannot say

658
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,700
Hey Kasi...

659
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,620
Because he cannot listen

660
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,540
I will kill rascal...
You manhandle my brother in front of me,idiot?

661
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:03,790
Hey..stop chitti.

662
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,750
Hey..kasi listen to me..

663
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,540
Hey Chitibabu, leave... Hey...

664
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,620
You manhandle my brother in front of me,idiot?

665
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,910
Hey Chittibabu...

666
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:32,620
Chittibabu...

667
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:33,830
What?

668
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,160
Seedlings have come up in my fields.

669
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,700
I am very happy and want to talk with you

670
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,330
Yes, I am taking these carriages to the fields

671
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,250
No, not that... You hit that fellow yesterday
at the celebrations right?

672
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,330
I felt very good

673
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,330
I felt has this boy hit for me?

674
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,450
Why did you hit?

675
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,830
You got so angry when I was commented right?

676
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,790
Oh no, see the anger is still the same

677
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Hey, where are the fields of Swamiraju?

678
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,410
Look, ladies are talking to me here.
Can you not see? Go on...

679
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,620
Hey stop, I am coming
Hey stop

680
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,250
What are you saying..?

681
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,870
Ok, they are looking for marriage matches at my home.

682
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,160
Do you have any intentions to marry me?

683
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,750
If yes tell me and I will inform my father tonight

684
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,660
Oh God, she is killing...

685
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,870
What are you looking here and there? My dad
will leave early in the morning to see the marriage matches

686
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,660
Look there, I have so many works.

687
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,040
We shall talk later, go and give this in our fields.

688
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,120
Careful

689
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,450
Right, right...

690
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,040
Hold on... hold on...

691
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:37,910
Hold on...

692
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,330
What is this, you brought me here
when I actually asked for the fields of Swamyraju?

693
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,160
Do you not know?

694
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:42,870
Hey, come here

695
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:47,160
Ramalakshmi just spoke something in front of them.
Find out what that is

696
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,910
Hello clerk sir
Yes

697
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,750
A girl just had spoken to our Chittibabu right?
What did she speak?

698
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:56,830
Oh that, she asked whether he would marry her.
If he likes, she said to inform by this night

699
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,790
What dude?
Chittibabu,

700
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,160
Ramalakshmi asked whether you would marry her

701
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,330
Really?
Yes

702
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,660
Have you heard properly?

703
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,410
Yes Chittibabu, it seems Ramalakshmi
asked whether you marry her

704
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,830
and asked to finalise the matter coming by this night

705
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,450
Now ask what do they need

706
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,790
Yes sir, what do you need?

707
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,950
Do not make sound..

708
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,540
be right there

709
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:50,370
Why did Ramalakshmi throw down so many things?
She is very lazy

710
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,540
Ramalakshmi...

711
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,830
Ramalakshmi..

712
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,950
Do not make sound,

713
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,660
Has he slept here?

714
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,200
Let us go.

715
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,540
Is she here? Why did she sleep after calling me?

716
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,450
Hey Ramalakshmi, come out
Come fast.

717
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,790
Why did you come here?

718
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:45,330
Ramalakshmi, you like me?

719
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,910
I like you too a lot. Yes

720
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:54,700
I mean, there were society people then
and I could not say anything

721
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,160
This liking is not born just now.
I saw you first time when you were bathing, right?

722
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,910
I liked you very much right then Lakshmi

723
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,790
Say your dad now, not to look for any other matches.
Just you and me...

724
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,250
Chittibabu, my dad is behind...
Hey, do not talk any more

725
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,950
Just give me two kisses and we shall enjoy

726
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,790
What is it? I came so silently and how did they get up?

727
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,500
What Uncle, do you people wake up
before the cock screams?

728
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:29,330
Ok, since anyway you got up...listen..
father in law I like your Lachmmi very much

729
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,830
Not just me father in law, even Lachmmi likes me a lot.

730
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,830
Hey Lakshmi, tell...
Lakshmi tell... tell

731
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,250
Come on..tell Lakshmi, say how much did we love

732
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,370
Hey rascal, what work do you have in my house?

733
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,330
You need my daughter, idiot?
Go, get out.

734
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,540
Get out idiot

735
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,330
Your parents have left you out like a starving animal
What happened ? What is the issue sir?

736
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,790
Why do you say what issues?
Why would someone come home in the midnight?

737
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:59,330
They may either come for a chick or a girl.

738
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:01,040
As far as I know, there are no chicks in this house

739
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:05,330
He is definitely come to do something to Ramalakshmi.
Why do you look so guys, finish this idiot

740
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,160
Hey, I am talking loud now rascal.
Hey, move...move.

741
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,950
What are you blabbering rascal, what happened now?

742
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,250
They both are in love and will talk. What is wrong?

743
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,830
You are all making it a mess
like some great mistake has happened

744
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:15,830
You come..

745
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,120
As your husband is not in town,
it may be ok if someone may come and go

746
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,500
Come..

747
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:31,540
What guys, are you seeing?

748
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,120
You come shouting when known this is some dirty relation

749
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,950
What have you done, my baby?

750
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,410
Hey, you may fall down

751
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,120
Take care, I said you would fall down.

752
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:39,870
Get down.

753
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,540
(Song Humming)

754
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,370
Aunty, my heart feels very sad

755
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:55,790
Yes son in law, once the heart is given
it would not return again

756
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,330
She hit so hard.

757
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,330
Even my brother never hit me so hard.
That short rascal hit me

758
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,080
Not hitting you, idiot. Maybe she felt like touching you hard

759
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,660
Hey, not so

760
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,700
When I put motor in fields of all,
she put the motor on in my eyes

761
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,000
See how the water is flowing out from the eyes

762
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,500
Oh no, do not look so dude. My husband is in Dubai

763
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:22,450
I will never leave her.
You remember aunty, I will kill her

764
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:26,540
I will chop her... put chillies...and squeeze her

765
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:28,160
Say in the morning dear

766
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,330
Oh no..

767
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,330
What is this?

768
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,750
No problem aunty, uncle is in Dubai right?

769
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:40,540
Hey, Aunty... I am getting disturbed just for ten days...

770
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,580
My life is like that, it is getting over just waiting.

771
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,660
This too is love it seems, father in law used to say

00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
What is that, give it here

773

00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,500
He is good looking right? Same like Chiranjeevi

775
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,000
Chiranjeevi right? I heard this

776
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,370
Why will it not be heard?

777
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,660
What is the issue between you and uncle?

778
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:10,080
What..? even uncle has put motor in your eyes?

779
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:11,830
Aunty..

780
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,540
How did you drink like that, aunty?

781
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,080
Drink the balance dude
Ok, ok

782
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,540
What more is left aunty, you cleared it all.

783
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:29,870
To hell with you

784
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,330
It is to inform all that as Matta Somaraju has
not repaid the loan taken from the society,

785
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,500
his land is being seized

786
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,200
What uncle, are you fine?

787
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,660
What is left son, it is over.

788
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,120
It is all over. Society people snatched everything

789
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:55,330
They used to just snatch the crop,
but they pulled off even the land.

790
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,950
They have seized everything

791
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,200
That Godavari is there for everything now

792
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,830
I will get into the lap of that mother.
I will jump into Godavari and end my life

793
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:03,830
Very good.

794
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,910
Then what, be on that job.
Go and look into that work, go

795
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,450
Thank God, we are saved

796
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,330
Uncle,

797
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,200

798
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,200
I just have 10 rupees dude

799
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,580
Only ten..?

800
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,330
Ok, let us look into that later

801
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,500
God gave you a great boon.

802
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,410
You cannot listen to the pain of anybody.
You are a lucky fellow

803
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:50,120
Rangamma aunt, Suribabu, Konda aunt come on...
Somaraju uncle jumped into Godavari

804
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:53,580
Rangamma aunty, uncle jumped into Godavari

805
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,750
Looks like he is swallowed water.
Uncle...

806
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,040
He jumped.
Uncle...

807
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,750
Brother, see...

808
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,790
Uncle... Move aside, let him get some air

809
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:03,580
Move..

810
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,790
Water has come

811
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,450
Uncle is alive

812
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,450
Uncle..careful

813
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:20,080
Uncle you are known for telling good things to all people.
If you only do like this, it is not correct.

814
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,870
What else would he do than to die
when society snatches all the land he has?

815
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,750
Oh no, will this society not let us live?

816
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,870
Uncle you come, let us go and ask..

817
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,620
Good that I have seen. If not, what would happened to you?

818
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:36,120
Yes Chittibabu, you cannot listen at all, right?

819
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,000
How did you know that I am jumping into Godavari?

820
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,870
He is asking how did you know that
he was jumping into Godavari?

821
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:48,660
Maybe I cannot listen to what you said uncle.
But I saw tears in your eyes

822
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,250
I got a doubt and turned back
and saw you jumping into Godavari river.

823
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,450
I just came and saved you

824
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:57,330
I should run the engine in the garden of Raju sir.
careful chitti.

825
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,540
You take care uncle

826
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:04,790
Our Chittibabu may be deaf but his heart very soft.
He is a good guy

827
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,910
Chittibabu... Hey Chittibabu

828
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:15,330
Hey, what?

829
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,580
You could see the pain from the eyes of Somaraju
but not the love in my eyes?

830
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,000
I like you.

831
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,830
I will marry only you and I will tell
my father not to look for any marriage matches

832
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,330
What are you talking low rascal,

You are like a tiny pot and who would marry you?

845
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,330
I am not marrying you, go

Hey Rangamma, Mangamma

869
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:58,120
Rangamma, Mangamma what a guy is he?
He is beside but never cares

870
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:39,500
I tied all my beauty in a bundle and I go to pulse field

871
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:45,660
Those honeybees come and sting me over here
and there and surround me

872
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:49,330
I tied all my beauty in a bundle and I go to pulse field

873
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:52,370
Those honeybees come and sting me over here
and there and surround me

874
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:58,450
He doesn't gush at them and make them go away
he doesn't respond or move such a stubborn man

875
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:04,620
He doesn't gush at them and make them go away
he doesn't respond or move such a stubborn man

876
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:07,540
Hey Rangamma, Mangamma

877
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:10,620
Hey Rangamma, Mangamma

878
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:16,620
Rangamma, Mangamma what a guy is he?
He is beside but never cares

879
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:23,410
Rangamma, Mangamma what a guy is he?
He is beside but never cares

880
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,620
I am asking when?

881
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:29,620
Kumar

882
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,910
How much did you take uncle?
Rs. 4000

883
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,250
How much have you paid till now?

884
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,660
I have been paying from the last 9 crops

885
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,080
How much is I per crop?

886
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:39,330
No idea son

887
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,950
What is this uncle, do you have the receipts?

888
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,450
What receipts son?

889
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,080
What are you talking?
Do I look like a mad girl?

890
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,750
I too studied till sixth class and know accounts.
I will not keep quiet.

891
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:49,700
Whom did you ask and put these flags?
You seize my crop?

892
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,250
What are you screaming?
Not that brother in law...

893
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,500
Debt is cleared long back as per my calculation.

894
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:57,620
My mom sold bangles before dying
and cleared when there was a bit.

895
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,950
They are seeing debt is still pending.

896
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,160
I even have the receipts brother in law
You have the receipts?

897
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,950
Brother, we both have fights
and I do not like you helping her

898
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,540
What are you in the middle, move

899
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,540
I will kill you rascal
Give that cardboard

900
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,620
How much have you taken dear?

901
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,330
10000

902
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:12,870
What..?

903
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,330
Have they seized it all

904
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,160
You should have it

905
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,330
Have you stopped eating as your son died?

906
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:21,700
You are into dirty crying
and you get a pain to repay the loan?

907
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,950
You have already paid 2000 more than what you took.

908
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:25,160
Come, we shall ask

909
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,330
Wipe your eyes and go,
else bad name would come for the Seshunaidu

910
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:29,910
Oh no, she is weeping a lot

911
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:33,410
What Kumar, looks like you have missed your way
and came here

912
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:34,580
Secretary sir

913
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,080
As per the accounts it looks like
debt of Ramalakshmi is cleared

914
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,040
But society people have seized her crops today.

915
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:41,620
Will you have a look into this and say?

916
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:44,250
Oh no, a guy has newly come in Rangasthalam
to question the accounts

917
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,410
You would leave soon to Dubai
and why all these for you?

918
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,580
Come on, how can we be silent
when there is a difference observed?

919
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,160
Come on show,
he is screaming as there are ladies to his side

920
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,370
Talk with sense, that badge will be lost

921
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,250
I saw so many

922
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,410
Great bank officer has come for checking.

923
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,910
Open up the eyes and see the debt here
Look

924
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:02,750
What is this? When the Principal is 10,
why is it written 20 here?

925
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:04,620
How much have you taken?
Just 10, brother in law

926
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,580
When your father took, how will you say?

927
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,410
I was just beside and it was me counting that

928
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,580
What is this?
Give that book here sir

929
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,080
Hey stop, what is that force?
Why do you get over us like that?

930
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:13,660
Give it here sir

931
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,160
Why do you pull away the society books?

932
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
See, all wrong accounts are here
Oh no...Blood.

933
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:19,660
You are not aware about how far would this matter go.
Hitting me is like hitting the President

934
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,200
I will see your matter at the village Assembly

935
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:24,000
Go and call the Police.
Come on, we shall go to the President Sir

936
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,580
You overact so much when President Sir is
out of town for two days, idiots?

937
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:41,330
Hey Kumar idiot, you know what happens
manhandling the society?

938
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:44,500
I will teach you a lesson at the Panchayat
Hey, what are you saying my brother?

939
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,500
What idiot, why is the voice raising?
Chitti, quiet

940
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:49,870
Hey get up
Ask him to first talk properly

941
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,750
Every idiot is coming into the house

942
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,250
Rangasthalam is lost systematic decency

943
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:59,330
Why have you stopped idiots?
Not on us but show your power on those

944
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:01,910
Your manliness will be out then

945
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,200
Is what I gave that day not enough rascal?

946
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:04,500
Hey Chitti, you stay calm
Be quiet dude

947
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:06,160
It is a promise on me, do not get in to fights

948
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:07,250
Mahesh, take him to a side

949
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,450
I am dying with these promises

950
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,830
You come sir

951
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:12,830
Oh no, he is Lord Srirama
and this fellow is the deaf Lakshmana

952
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,580
Your Rangasthala Ramayan is great guys

953
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:18,580
President Sir...

954
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,370
Hello Sir

955
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:44,660
What Koteswara Rao?

956
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,620
Sir

957
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,620
Is this how you brought up?

958
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:48,830
Not that, President Sir

959
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,950
You wait son
Do you not know to keep sons under control?

960
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,790
My elder son is not so Sir.

961
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,120
As daughter of Pallalu has asked for a help...

962
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,200
Yes, President Sir...

963
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,830
Ramalakshmi has taken 10000 and they wrote 20000

964
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,250
Many in the village are into troubles because of society

965
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,540
Erra Srinu son of Narasimham has recently taken his life having
the poision as he could not repay the debt to this Society

966
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:07,750
Just recently here,

967
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,200
Come..Somaraju uncle.

968
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,160
even Somaraju uncle jumped into Godavari

969
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:13,330
It was ok as my brother Chittibabu came and saved.

970
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:18,000
What, what is my brother saying?
He is saying great about you

971
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:20,000
What do you say now?

972
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:25,830
You say they are writing wrong accounts in the society and
injustice has been done to the family of Ramalakshmi right?

973
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:26,410
Yes Sir

974
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,200
Hey Secretary
Sir

975
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:30,790
How much has Pallalu taken?

976
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,120
He is taken 20000 as per the accounts of Society Sir

977
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,910
Hey Pallalu
Sir

978
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,410
How much have you taken?
Sir, that is...

979
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,870
We took 10000 sir, I was right there

980
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,120
Hey, you are a girl and what do you know accounts?

981
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,000
No Sir, I studied till sixth class

982
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:48,870
Oh no...

983
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:54,120
I am laughing for now
but say what has he spoken tonight dude

984
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:56,250
Hey Pallau,

985
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,950
Hey Seshu Naidu Sir is talking listen

986
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,410
I am talking to you.
I am on the same job Boss

987
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:02,660
President Sir is asking right? Is what you took 10 or 20?

988
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,580
Say clearly, you drunkard rascal

989
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,120
I took 20000 sir

990
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:13,700
Ok Pallau, you go

991
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,620
Why did you change word so father

992
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:19,500
Hey, I am being quiet as you are a motherless child,
you ruined my prestige and put me at Panchayat.

993
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:20,620
Move now to the house.

994
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,120
What is that dude, why is Ramalakshmi leaving?
You wait Sir

995
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:26,120
That is the matter, it is clear now right?

996
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,330
As Kumar hit the society clerk,

997
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:34,330
for none to again point at society again in the village,
please declare that penalty Sir

998
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:36,700
What dude?

999
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:43,870
Penalty is Rs.20,000

1000
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,660
Koteswara Rao, bring and pay the money
at Panchayat in two days

1001
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:50,910
What is it Sir,

1002
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:53,950
how can I bring so much money as of now?

1003
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:58,620
Do one thing. You have two acres land right?
Sell that, bring and pay

1004
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,040
Here, our Raju Sir is also ready to buy.

1005
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:01,910
What Sir?
Yes.

1006
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,790
I will go and bring 10000 as advance right away

1007
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,330
How can we sell that land sir?

1008
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:10,120
That is the hard earned land by mother
selling milk and cow dung

1009
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,540
Was it hard earned?

1010
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:15,500
Why do all in village say that father of President
has written that on the name of your mother?

1011
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,120
Hey you, what are you talking?

1012
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,540
It is what is the truth

1013
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:19,660
Wait..

1014
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,750
What dad, what is wrong?

1015
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,160
Nothing, they are asking us to pay the penalty.

1016
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,080
Why would we pay, we will not pay

1017
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,200
What?

1018
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:30,700
I will bring the papers and give tomorrow morning sir

1019
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,370
Ok, go now

1020
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,410
Do whatever you can and we are not going to pay

1021
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:45,160
Enough of the amusement you had, go now idiots

1022
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:54,330
No stability in lives but started to better the village

1023
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:58,160
Mom, it was great to see dad talking today

1024
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:01,500
When Seshu Naidu asked to pay the fine
he strongly said not to pay

1025
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:03,950
What brother?
Yes.

1026
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:05,910
You too spoke great

1027
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,750
Why all these for us, son?

1028
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,540
No problem in losing the land but we lost the prestige

1029
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,120
What did you cook mom?
Fish curry..serve it.

1030
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,870
I will eat more..

1031
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,200
What dude, is father not hungry?

1032
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:27,910
Hey, give that curry.

1033
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,580
Nothing, I thought it may get spoilt by morning

1034
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,620
What is the news today Mahesh, start the cassette?

1035
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,200
Nothing much today sir

1036
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:50,120
Milk Satyam came opposite in the way this morning right?

1037
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:53,500
His granddaughter is into puberty and
asked us to come for lunch tomorrow

1038
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:57,200
Not that dude, say what happened today at the Panchayat

1039
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,080
At the Panchayat? You know what happened right?

1040
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:04,250
Not that dude, all laughed when Ramalakshmi
said something right? Say what that is

1041
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,330
Oh that,

1042
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:08,580
when President sir said she is a girl
and how will she know all these accounts

1043
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:13,410
Ramalakshmi said she studied up to sixth class
and all laughed loud for that

1044
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,450
Have they laughed dude?

1045
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:19,540
If not, she is egoistic that she studied more than us.

1046
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,910
She would be down now

1047
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,540
And after that you know it.

1048
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:26,040
That Pallala changed his word
and they asked your brother to pay fine

1049
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,330
And we said not to pay that and that is all.

1050
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:29,830
See you now.
Hey Mahesh, sit down dude

1051
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:31,910
Yes Mahesh,

1052
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,410
Seshu Naidu said something while getting down the steps.

1053
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:35,950
What did he say?

1054
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,290
What did he say, he said to sell your land and pay the fine

1055
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,120
What, just for that my brother said strongly to talk properly?

1056
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:46,040
That is, the land was hard earned by
your grandmother and it is a sentiment for us.

1057
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,540
Will one not get angry when asked to sell that?

1058
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:48,830
Yes, we should get anger

1059
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,750
Still, brain is working great for my idiot brother these days

1060
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:51,830
What Chittibabu...

1061
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:55,500
Your dad used to daily come for the leaves after food
and why did he not come today?

1062
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,370
What do I know?

1063
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:58,000
Maybe he is not hungry
and did not have food even at home.

1064
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,910
What hunger will he have for what Seshu Naidu said?

1065
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,830
We ourselves felt bad listening to the words
and definetly your father would have felt very very bad?

1066
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,500
Oh no, he said so dirty and that is very wrong

1067
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:11,450
It is time for my Chitralahari and I will leave now

1068
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,330
What did Seshu Naidu say?

1069
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:16,500
That is, I said right Sir...

1070
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:18,830
What did Seshu Naidu say?

1071
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:21,700
I said that he asked to sell land of
your grandma and pay the fine, right Sir?

1072
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:24,250
Remember well and say

1073
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:26,000
I just remember this, see you Sir

1074
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,950
Better remember well.
better tell me what Seshu Naidu has said?

1075
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,660
My mother is alone and I will leave

1076
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,290
I will kill you rascal,

1077
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,750
say what Seshu Naidu said to my father

1078
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:39,870
When he said how can we sell the hard earned land from
selling milk and cow dung,

1079
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,200
that filthy rascal said...

1080
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,870
Is it hard earned by selling milk and cow dung?

1081
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,660
He said father of President gave
that in writing to his mother to your dad

1082
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,250
Your dad felt like he is dead Sir

1083
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,580
I too felt bad as he said so to your father.

1084
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,290
He said so bad to your father...

1085
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:09,830
See you Seshu Naidu Sir

1086
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,410
Hey, where are you going Errababu?

1087
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:16,250
It seems Rattalu’s hubby is not home and
she said can’t sleep alone,

1088
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,750
I wanted to make her sleep at my wife

1089
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,580
His work is better than mine

1090
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,830
Come on, throw the card

1091
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,620

You unnecessarily hit men of that President, Chittibabu.
Why these fights for us?

1121
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,290
All this is because of that Ramalakshmi.

1122
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,700
My brother has unnecessarily backed her up

1123
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,830
Bloody hell, anger on her is not down
how much ever I drink dude

1124
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,910
Love is like that Chittibabu,

1125
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,450
it keeps oozing out like Toddy as we keep scratching

1126
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,290
There, she is come

1127
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:53,410

Keep one pail of toddy for me
I will just come, dude

1130
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:01,700
What?

1131
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,750
It seems you are not talking with Ramalakshmi?

1132
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,660
What will she do for the deeds of her dad?

1133
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:14,160
You dirty idiot, can you hit a girl?

1134
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,250
You do not get worried

1135
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:18,910
You think she is any ordinary lady?
She got my brother insulted.

1136
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,950
She is even made my brother into an idiot at the Panchayat

1137
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:28,450
She is not any less, it is a habit for her.
It is a habit to make idiots before all

1138
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:31,580
what have you done when
I came to your house day before night?

1139
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:34,580
What did you do..?
Did you not hit me hard?

1140
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,580
Yes, she would hit. Her breed is like that

1141
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:45,700
Her dad, her dog, her chicken
and everyone at her house has that same brain

1142
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Take her away from here, I do not know what I may do..
Not that

1143
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:52,200
She likes you very much and she has come to say that.

1144
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,540
You say
Oh no

1145
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,830
You say
Really?

1146
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:56,200
You wait... You say...

1147
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,290

1148
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:00,000

01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,830

01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:05,830
I like you
Say loud

1151
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:07,500
Come near, come on

1152
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,910
I said to talk loud
I know the same way to say

1153
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:13,540
See, she says only that aloud.

1154
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:17,580
She says the words making me an idiot aloud
but she says love on me at low voice

1155
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:23,000
Her dirty face and her dirty breed...

1156
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,950
She is high on cholesterol, you do not back her up. Go...

1157
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,160
Hey, are you Chittibabu?

1158

He cannot listen unless spoken aloud sir

1181

Are you deaf? Can you not hear?

1182
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:39,580
Who said, I can listen great.
I can listen however anybody speaks

01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,620
Not that Sir, they are badly hitting him

1208
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:08,830
Have it

1209
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,540
Sir...

1210
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:22,540
It is wrong to hit Seshu Naidu Sir. I am saying Sorry for that.

1211
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,290
I will see to that it will not repeat.

1212
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,830
SI says to let go if you call and say one word sir

1213
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,580
They said a hit for animal and a word for the human

1214
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:36,250
Animal listen when hit and
the human listens when said a word

1215
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:39,120
Poor fellow, your brother cannot hear even when said right?

1216
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:42,450
Maybe he gets some enlightenment after hitting

1217
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,200
Let them hit, he will spend time there for two days

1218
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:50,660
My brother cannot bear hunger Sir, please say a word

1219
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:55,250
Hey, you know what my name is?

1220
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:57,620
Hey Umbrella
Sir

1221
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,370
What is my name?
President Sir

1222
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,160
Bangarraju
Sir

1223
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:03,540
What is my name?

1224
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,830
President Sir, right Sir?

1225
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:10,250
Not just these but none knows my name in this village

1226
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:12,290
Who is that?
Ammiraju Sir

1227
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,000
Have you seen that flag?

1228
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:18,540
Be in the line...

1229
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:23,910
You know why is one single flag flying in this village?

1230
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:29,200
That is not the greatness of party but the value my word has

1231
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:36,120
You asked me to put forward a word right?
To say that, my word should have a value

1232
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:39,750
Whatever happens in this village,
It should happen after informing me

1233
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:44,080
if that does not happen...It happens like this only.

1234
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,000
I understood sir

1235
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:46,580
I will take care that it never repeats again.

1236
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:50,750
I fear that they may kill him
Please just put in a word sir

1237
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,290
What, even you cannot hear?

1238
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,370
I will look into that and what else?

1239
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:01,290
Clean the glass and then go.

1240
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,750
Hey, your brother has come.
Get up.

1241
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:16,330
Getup idiot, your brother has got you bail

1242
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,330
Get up, your brother has come

1243
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:32,370
Chitti, careful

1244
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,040
Hey, keep it dude

1245
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:39,830
Serve it quick..I am very hungry

1246
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,830
Open it

1247
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:54,410
Why so late to get a bail? I was dead here with hunger

1248
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,750
Who would give when you oppose the President?

1249
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:05,200
Hey, give water fast

1250
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,950
They hit me badly brother, here...

1251
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,830
I forgot, remember that SI rascal
and we shall look into him later.

1252
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:21,290
Okay.

1253
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,700
What?
Brother says ok, Sir

1254
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:29,410
and that constable fellow too...

1255
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,250
I will remind you...you eat sir.

1256
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:48,540
Brother

1257
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:49,950
Chitti..careful

1258
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:51,290
Why did you bring here?

1259
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:56,750
Hey, brother...

1260
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:57,500
Hello sir.

1261
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:00,750
What is the work?

1262
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:01,290
You wait dude.

1263
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,330
I need the nomination papers of president post

1264
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:04,660
What is the name?

1265
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:06,410
Chelluboina Kumar Babu

1266
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:09,000
Name of your father?
Koteswara Rao

1267
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:10,830
Which village?

1268
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,080
Rangasthalam

1269
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:22,290
Hey, What happened to him?

1270
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:24,200
Nothing

1271
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:30,830
What man, are you from Rangasthalam?

1272
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:31,870
Yes sir

1273
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,330
Have you come to file nomination for the post of President?

1274
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:35,700
Hey..
Yes sir.

1275
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,620
I have been waiting from so long for this moment.

1276
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:43,750
Come on sign

1277
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,040
Their games will not run from now on..

1278
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:13,620
How much more long would you look down
at the ground, President Sir?

1279
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:20,080
Look up for once, a new flag has come to Rangasthalam

1280
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:25,580
Villagers got bored seeing same President
and one flag for so long, President Sir

1281
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:27,080
Village is wishing for a change now

1282
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:33,950
Thus, I filed nomination as President
in the elections this time

1283
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,120
We came to put a word to you as a respect.

1284
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:43,120
Huh, hairs!

1285
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,700
Yes...

1286
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:49,120
My brother may not listen unless spoken aloud

1287
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:53,410
But for you....you could not listen so far
as there was none to talk loudly till now

1288
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,700
There are many problems in the village President sir.

1289
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,080
Village is the same as it was in my childhood

1290
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,540
They are looting people on the name of society debts.

1291
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,120
I know who is behind all that

1292
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:10,700
That is why, the village will not change
unless the power changes hands

1293
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,830
Brother, I heard this. Shall I say?

1294
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:17,660
Sir, politics have started in Rangasthalam.

1295
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:21,410
Get ready for the elections Mr. Phanindra Bhupathi Sir

1296
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:36,160
What, you feel to have heard it somewhere?
Maybe you forgot, it is your name

1297
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,160
See you, Phanindra Bhupathi sir

1298
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,410
Move dude
Move

1299
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,000
It will now be the interval for him, brother

1300
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:59,620
Even the breed eating grass is raising their voice,
how did they get so much courage President Sir?

1301
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:05,040
This courage is not theirs but of the flag they are carrying

1302
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:19,120
The boys we got bail have come

1303
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,000
Come sit..

1304
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,910
You did a great work guys.

1305
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:30,910
It was my dream from 20 years
to have my party flag in your village

1306
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,330
It is being fulfilled after so long.

1307
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:38,410
I have never at least stepped into
your village because of that President

1308
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:44,950
He is like demon Bakasura,
he is eating away the money of public

1309
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:52,870
I am an MLA for this constituency but not for Rangasthalam

1310
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:56,160
Not just a single vote,
I did not get even a single vote in your village

1311
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:00,290
Now I got the confidence.

1312
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,910
You have to work hard

1313
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,200
Work hard

1314
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:05,500
Ok sir

1315
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:09,750
Your village should develop and ask for any help you need

1316
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:13,870
I will risk even my life for your victory

1317
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:30,160
He is Dr. Murthy and he did the surgery

1318
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:34,080
here was a deep wound on the head
We almost removed blood clots

1319
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,750
and we did the best to our efforts.

1320
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,080
He is not responding for anything.
He is gone into a coma

1321
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,700
As far as I know, it is tough for him to be alive

1322
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:45,080
Why tough Doctor, what tough?

1323
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:47,830
He is breathing right?

1324
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:52,200
His heart is also beating
and how can you say he will die?

1325
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,500
If he was to die, he should’ve been dead
when the Lorry dashed him

1326
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:55,870
He will not die, are you any God to say?

1327
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,410
What sir, you will live right?

1328
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:03,910
He will live it seems, he said and I heard it

1329
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:08,370
You should live sir, you should live.
You have to make him live

1330
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:13,200
Nothing will happen to you sir..

1331
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:14,870
I will take care.

1332
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,980
Ok madam, you understood please sign on this

1333
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,850
What madam.. what are you doing doctor?

1334
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,100
It’s tough now

1335
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,350
It’s tough now

1336
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,310
You too have been seeing from so long.
It’s the same whatever we may wait

1337
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:40,060
Thus we had to come take this decision

1338
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:40,600
What does it mean?

1339
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,440
You wish to kill him?

1340
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:45,400
No son, we too are feeling sad.

1341
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:48,400
But the Doctors are saying it’s tough right?

1342
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:50,980
How long would you work hard more?

1343
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:54,810
Still. How long more can we keep him so?

1344
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:55,520
Don’t say like that please

1345
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:57,270
Our fate is like that....
We have nothing more

1346
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,600
I am indebted to him

1347
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,560
He will live. I need him Doctor sir

1348
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,480
Do one thing, all of you leave in a feeling that he is dead

1349
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,690
If he lives by chance, I’ll bring him to you

1350
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:10,270
Give it that.

1351
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,770
Come on, have the curry.

1352
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:36,060
I feel pity seeing you Chittibabu.

1353
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:37,810
You don’t eat in time, sleep in full

1354
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:41,350
Why do you work so hard day and night
for a person you have no relation with?

1355
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,310
Go back to your village get into some work

1356
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:47,230
Look Chittibabu, what’ve I said now?

1357
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:57,900
Hey Ramalaxmi... Hey Ramalaxmi stop...

1358
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:00,060
Hey Laxmi... I can't run with you..Laxmi stop

1359
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:02,100
Hey, stop.

1360
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:05,810
Hey stop... where will you go...

1361
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:10,770
Will you talk the same way even after
your brother becomes the President?

1362
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:11,310
What?

1363
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:14,150
You... Won’t you leave this stick till you get your snake?

1364
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,310
Why do you talk loud? Why not speak low?

1365
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,900
Is ours a love to have eyes in eyes to talk silently?

1366
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:23,100
Ours is a love to shout loud in the ears

1367
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,190
Not that dear,

1368
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:28,350
we too have a system to speak slowly
and with love. Sit, I’ll say.

1369
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,310
Come on sit

1370
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:31,230
Listen, I’ll say what our system is

1371
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:32,560
Ok, say

1372
01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:34,650
Now, I’ll say what Ramalaxmi dear

1373
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:37,350
For that you reply saying, you say Chittibabu

1374
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,980
Then I’ll say why are your eyes so red

1375
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,690
You’ll reply, when did you let me sleep
coming into dreams for the whole night

1376
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,060
I’ll say, if so give me a kiss Ramalaxmi

1377
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:49,980
You should then feel shy and say can’t kiss so

1378
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,350
Then I’ll hold you tight and kiss

1379
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,980
If it is so, we can talk even if you talk in low voice.

1380
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,230
What a brain?

1381
01:29:58,650 --> 01:29:59,650
Ready?
Yes

1382
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:04,190
What Ramalaxmi?
Say Chittibabu

1383
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:05,940
Why are your eyes so red, dear?

1384
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,060
I had no sleep for the whole night.
You came into my dreams

1385
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,480
If so, give me a kiss dear

1386
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,060
Hey..

1387
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,690
I should kiss and you must feel shy right?

1388
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:17,440
Ok kiss

1389
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,150
What?
Someone is laughing

1390
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,440
Hey, I cannot listen right? Come on...

1391
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:29,850
Right here...

1392
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:37,060
Hey, you go home.

1393
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:39,060
There is someone and I’ll have a look

1394
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:40,190
Careful...

1395
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:43,190
Chittibabu, careful...

1396
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:50,440
Powers of the Kings ruling are vanished at this place...

1397
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:57,400
The black beeds of a tender wife
have broken down at this place...

1398
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:09,810
This is the stage where the
Evil lord dances along with the ghosts

1399
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:11,650
Rangasthalam...

1400
01:31:11,810 --> 01:31:14,940
Oh no Ganapathi uncle... What is that?

1401
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:17,310
It seems you were dead falling under the train, right uncle?

1402
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:20,850
Oh no, have they ended my role so in Rangasthalam?

1403
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:24,310
The same play from the past 30 years.

1404
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:30,560
There will be no hero in this play,
there would just be the villain called the President

1405
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:39,100
If anybody tries to become the
President his role ends right here in this mud

1406
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:43,310
It’s like someone is dying if our village has elections

1407
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:44,770
Hey, what are you talking?

1408
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:46,940
Has your brother filed nominations?

1409
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:49,150
Is he wishing to become the leader?
Yes

1410
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:51,270
His role too would end

1411
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:56,980
You don’t know who they are
and from where they would come.

1412
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:02,940
They come when this Rangasthalam
is asleep and end the roles

1413
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:06,350
Don’t leave, don’t leave your brother alone.

1414
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:10,190
It’ll end, the role will end.

1415
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,400
Careful, be careful

1416
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:19,810
I had to file the nomination in a compulsory situation,

1417
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:20,900
please understand Padma

1418
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:22,100
Don’t say anything else

1419
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,600
What did you say me?

1420
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:26,600
You said we’ll get married and go away once you get a job

1421
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:29,810
You said we can both live happily.

1422
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:31,400
All those are false statements right?

1423
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,190
What happened now?

1424
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,650
I do not understand why you did so?

1425
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:39,270
Who’s that?

1426
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:42,150
Who’s that?

1427
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,850
Hey...
Brother, it’s me Chittibabu.

1428
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,850
What are you doing here Chitti?

1429
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,190
Nothing I followed in a fear that
something may happen to you

1430
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,270
What’ll happen to me?

1431
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:08,480
It seems they would kill if anyone who contests
opposite to the President

1432
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:09,850
Who said so?

1433
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:10,650
What?

1434
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:13,100
Who said so?
Hey, silent

1435
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:15,480
Ganapathi uncle said me

1436
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:21,480
Go away.. you...

1437
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:27,560
Hey... Chitti... Chitti, he is a mad fellow

1438
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:32,270
He keeps roaming singing poems and saying
someone is killed and his madness has gone to peaks.

1439
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,730
Mad... He is mad, right?
Yes Chitti

1440
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,690
I too got a doubt brother

1441
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:40,190
That’s why I didn’t care much

1442
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:41,560
Is it sound Engineer sir?

1443
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:47,310
President is gone high in sarcasm
Thank you

1444
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:48,730
I’ll beat you up if you overact

1445
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:53,060
(Chants)

1446
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:58,730
All villagers are into thinking why is the President silent
when they came in lungi and slippers and challenged

1447
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:03,900
That Dakshinamurthy has no courage to step into this
village and no idea what their courage is seeing him

1448
01:34:04,190 --> 01:34:07,850
What is a festival when it is cleaned up dude?
There should be ward members to file nomination right?

1449
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:11,980
Who would step forward opposing the President Sir?
Who is such a man in Rangasthalam?

1450
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,650
Hey Edukondalu, my brother is contesting
this time in the President elections

1451
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,060
and you all need to be with him

1452
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:25,230
If not, I’ll not put engine in your fields
and they would go dry. Take care

1453
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:26,850
Chittibabu, I’m talking right? You be quiet

1454
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,230
No bro, they should have some fear

1455
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:29,520
Ok, you talk
Ok, sit

1456
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,060
Are you fine uncle?

1457
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:35,150
We’re just living son. What is the matter?

1458
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:38,350
You know right, I am contesting as the President.

1459
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:42,100
I felt it would be good if you are the member
for this eighth ward.

1460
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:45,440
What’s it, there is already a President for this village right?
Why another President again?

1461
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:56,270
It is not as easy to wave the flag to win the elections, idiot

1462
01:35:02,770 --> 01:35:04,810
Come on, it is being said for your good right?

1463
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:09,850
When nobody is coming,
it should either be a fear or a confidence

1464
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:11,650
If fear, nothing can be done,

1465
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:13,480
if confidence, that should be driven out

1466
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:17,230
We should make all know that President is the
one behind the scams of society

1467
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:19,400
Oh no..you go..go.

1468
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,100
Hello sir..

1469
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:25,560
Sir, checking officers have come there

1470
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,150
Oh no

1471
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:28,350
Rongali Chandramma and took 10000

1472
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,690
Give the pass book

1473
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,350
The Principal take is just 6000 sir

1474
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,850
Matta Somaraju, taken 8000
Oh God

1475
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:39,060
Principal taken is 5000 sir

1476
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,940
Kota Ranga has taken 6000
Just 3000 sir

1477
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:47,060
Pullam Narasamma has taken 12000

1478
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,190
Narasamma
I took only 6000 sir

1479
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,520
Even my son committed suicide
for not being able to pay this debt

1480
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:54,690
See officer...This is the situation

1481
01:35:55,230 --> 01:35:57,270
What man, is it become a habit to eat well?

1482
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,560
What are these wrong accounts?

1483
01:35:58,770 --> 01:36:01,770
Have you understood at least now,
how they are looting you on the name of society?

1484
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,940
The same took place recently even in
the case of Ramalakshmi’s father.

1485
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,650
They cheated him and made him lie

1486
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:08,350
This is all a drama played by that President
and that Seshu Naidu is just a puppet

1487
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,520
They are looting the whole village keeping him in middle

1488
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,060
You are looking to him as a God

1489
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:16,770
Say one thing, has the village changed
in his rule or have our lives got better?

1490
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:20,150
For you, I filed nominations as President for you people

1491
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,230
Support me and file nominations as ward member

1492
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:26,400
Even my nomination goes waste
if none of you come forward

1493
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:28,310
Give it a thought

1494
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:31,690
What are you still thinking,
come on file the nomination as a ward member

1495
01:36:31,730 --> 01:36:33,810
What are you doing here when President
Sir has started the worship?

1496
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:35,730
Come on..move.

1497
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:38,400
one minute...please listen what I am saying?
Somaraju Uncle..

1498
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:44,270
Uncle... Katamaiah... Where are you going?

1499
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:44,810
Wait

1500
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:55,650
All the villagers have become enemies
for what these are doing

1501
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:57,440
None are talking to us.

1502
01:36:57,690 --> 01:36:59,400
When none have a problem, why just for us?

1503
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,150
Chinni..
Mom, give it here

1504
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:01,270
Hey go idiot.
give some water

1505
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:04,060
Do we have any properties or what?

1506
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:06,400
What son, have you asked all?

1507
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:07,520
There is a girl for marriage at home

1508
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,150
We asked dad, none is coming forward
and what do you wish to do?

1509
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:13,100
You shall ask all friends and even enemies in such times.

1510
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:15,060
No hesitations.
Looks like he will not leave even if they let go

1511
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:18,060
If he is so, will these not become like this?
Chitti come

1512
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:18,650
See you mom

1513
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,480
Where are you going again?

1514
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,270
Wait... Will you ask this face?

1515
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,850
Come on, we just get fooled by asking but no use, move

1516
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:31,150
Not that Chitti
Hey..move.

1517
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:32,230
Look, listen to me

1518
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:33,440
I said no, right?

1519
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:36,560
Here, you be here
No bro

1520
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:37,350
I will go and come

1521
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,770
You are a great guy dude
Mahesh, take care of him

1522
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,060
Brother is saying to go and ask right Sir, what for you?

1523
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:48,060
What Kasi, are you fine?

1524
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:52,940
Listen properly to what he is saying.
You wait.

1525
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:55,060
You said say me again in the night
Ok, I will say

1526
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:58,100
You know right Kasi, I filed nominations as President

1527
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:00,730
None is coming forward
for nominations as ward members, none

1528
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:04,940
All are running away in fear,
you know why am I doing all this right?

1529
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,150
Kasi, enough to have a guy like you
and the whole village gets courage

1530
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:14,310
That’s why Kasi, I came to ask
if you file nomination as the ward member

1531
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,400
What, I should file nomination as ward member for you?

1532
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,690
You should have some shame to ask

1533
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,310
What is that Kasi’s brother raising over brother and talking,

1534
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:21,650
Come on... listen
I’m listening

1535
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:25,060
Why, did you forget what happened at the celebrations?
I will not keep quiet if he overact now

1536
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,350
Yes, say no way and send him back

1537
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,600
Go..go. Hey wait

1538
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:31,270
Kumar Babu, I will support you

1539
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:33,480
Hey brother, what are you talking?

1540
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,730
Hey, till date they hit us and we hit them

1541
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:40,060
But is there any man who hit President’s guy?

1542
01:38:40,690 --> 01:38:41,730
Chittibabu has hit

1543
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:43,400
Why is that Kasi pointing finger?

1544
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,060
And thus his brother is got the courage
today to file nomination

1545
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,650
Still, is he doing all this for his good?

1546
01:38:48,730 --> 01:38:50,690
He is doing this all for the development of the village

1547
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:52,440
Hey...
Hey, be quiet guys.

1548
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:55,060
It is a waste if we do not support at least now

1549
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:57,900
Kumar Babu, I am behind you.

1550
01:38:58,060 --> 01:39:00,480
I’ll do whatever you say. Say me what to do.

1551
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,980
He is talking with his hands moving,
listen what he is saying

1552
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:06,100
Sir, you cannot listen and not me.
I can listen even being here

1553
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:07,310
This is enough Kasi

1554
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,650
Come on Kumar Babu

1555
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:10,150
I’ll break his finger if something goes wrong.

1556
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:12,850
Oh no, your brother is seeing angrily at me.

1557
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:14,770
Go and say him what I said, else he may again hit me

1558
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:19,190
Chitti, Kasi said to support us

1559
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:20,190
What?

1560
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:22,190
First say what I said about him

1561
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:24,100
He said we fought each other in the village till date

1562
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:28,270
but your brother hit President’s guy and he is great

1563
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,440
Is it?
Yes

1564
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:30,400
You’re great dude.

1565
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,350
If you are on our side, whole village can be trapped

1566
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:35,440
We have no looking back now

1567
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:41,310
Will you be on that shore Naganna, will you come this side?

1568
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:46,810
Will you be on that shore Naganna, will you come this side?

1569
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:56,060
Will you be on that shore Naganna, will you come this side?

1570
01:39:56,520 --> 01:40:01,230
Will you be on that shore Naganna, will you come this side?

1571
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:06,900
There is bottle full of arrack, pot full of toddy
and so much Brandy on that shore

1572
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:10,440
There is a tumbler full of buttermilk on this shore

1573
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:15,190
Will you be on that shore Naganna, will you come this side?

1574
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:20,060
Will you be on that shore Naganna, will you come this side?

1575
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:45,100
Will you be on that heap Naganna, will you come this side?

1576
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:50,150
Will you be on that heap Naganna, will you come this side?

1577
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:55,690
There is batch of wolves, group of foxes
and gang of bandicoots on that heap

1578
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:59,310
There is herd of cows in this heap

1579
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:04,060
Will you be on that heap Naganna, will you come this side?

1580
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:08,810
Will you be on that heap Naganna, will you come this side?

1581
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:23,850
Will you be on that doorstep Naganna,
will you come this side?

1582
01:41:24,230 --> 01:41:28,940
Will you be on that doorstep Naganna,
will you come this side?

1583
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:34,520
There is poisonous food, waste plants
and the weed on that doorstep

1584
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,940
There is the sandalwood in this doorstep

1585
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:42,690
Will you be on that doorstep Naganna,
will you come this side?

1586
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:47,650
Will you be on that doorstep Naganna,
will you come this side?

1587
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:49,850
Have it son

1588
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:54,190
What dear, feeding sweets already to the bridegroom?

1589
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:56,600
What am I to do when my dad is sitting
with poison bottle in hands?

1590
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:57,900
Get up rascals
Hey Chittibabu

1591
01:41:57,940 --> 01:41:59,060
What are you eating, get up rascals

1592
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:00,270
What are you doing Chittibabu?

1593
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:01,310
Ramalakshmi is mine

1594
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:02,440
Take your hands off

1595
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:03,150
Take your hands off

1596
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:05,440
It’s because of you.
They’re getting her married fearing because of you

1597
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,600
How will they give hands to a guy opposing the President?

1598
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:09,150
Will the whole village not exile them
if they give her to you in marriage?

1599
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:12,650
Still, you have no base and how would you
take care of her, if you get married to her?

1600
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:16,850
Ok, do one thing. I will somehow plead,
request President Sir and get money

1601
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:18,730
You say your brother to take back the nominations

1602
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:21,230
Then I‘ll give Ramalakshmi’s hand to you in marriage

1603
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,560
Why till then, I’ll give the money right now.
You take her hand, go

1604
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:25,100
Yes..take.

1605
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:27,100
Take the money, at least you get better

1606
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:31,480
So, you too have joined hands in President’s politics.

1607
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:34,850
I neither need this money nor Ramalakshmi.
Get her married to anyone you like

1608
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:36,810
But the vote should be to my brother

1609
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:44,520
Will you be on that side Naganna, will you come this side?

1610
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:49,270
Will you be on that side Naganna, will you come this side?

1611
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:53,850
There is justice, law, our own this side

1612
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:55,520
And that side...

1613
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:10,150
There is an anti to all these on that side

1614
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:10,810
That means?

1615
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,850
Injustice, illegal and not our own

1616
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:14,730
So...

1617
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:19,690
Will you be on that shore Naganna, will you come this side?

1618
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:24,440
Will you be on that shore Naganna, will you come this side?

1619
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:28,190
Come on aunt, put a sign here.
Aunt will sign

1620
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:28,850
Aunt..

1621
01:43:34,350 --> 01:43:37,690
Kumar babu..I’ll contest as the ward member

1622
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,190
Hey..come on..
Take the chair.

1623
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:40,350
Please be seated

1624
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:06,730
Hey Rangamma aunty, come out

1625
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:15,060
When all supported my brother in the Evening,
why did you turn your face and go away?

1626
01:44:15,730 --> 01:44:24,060
Yes, your husband is in Dubai and
sends Dirhams every month and you sit here getting ready

1627
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:29,100
You have any debt or pain from the society?

1628
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:31,850
You...
Come inside

1629
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:34,770
Like how all call you in the village,
I too will call the same from tomorrow

1630
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,770
I am saying to come in
I’ll look at like all

1631
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:40,060
Come on...
I don't need your Engine...I’ve no relation at all with you

1632
01:44:40,150 --> 01:44:40,810
That's all.

1633
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:42,900
Why are you closing the doors?

1634
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:49,980
My brother will not lose just with your single vote
and we don’t need your vote, go

1635
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,940
What, fish curry again?

1636
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:58,730
I quit eating fish. I’ll not eat your fish at all

1637
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:02,310
I don’t need you or your fish
Eat

1638
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:04,310
I’ll not eat

1639
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:05,850
Don’t overact, just eat

1640
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:10,270
Ok, say this first.

1641
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,690
Why didn’t you sign in the Evening?

1642
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:17,690
How to say the pain from heart to you
when you can’t listen unless said aloud?

1643
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:18,560
What?

1644
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:21,150
Whom did you ask and file the nominations?
Did you ask me and file?

1645
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,650
Whom to ask for doing a good deed?
We just filed, that’s all

1646
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:25,730
Are you the only men in the village?

1647
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,940
You think none opposed President till date?

1648
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:29,650
You remember Erra Sreenu?

1649
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:30,560
I know

1650
01:45:30,650 --> 01:45:31,480
How did he die?

1651
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:33,900
Jumping recently into Godavari

1652
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:35,350
Why, does he not know swimming?

1653
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:37,190
Abbulu then, how did Abbulu die?

1654
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:40,060
That fellow, he died drinking pesticide

1655
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:41,520
Then why were knife wounds on the body?

1656
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,980
Were they there?

1657
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:46,900
You know when would guy who can swim Godavari
from this end to that, die drowning in a canal?

1658
01:45:47,650 --> 01:45:48,810
When opposing President

1659
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,190
Come on.. Eat..

1660
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:56,060
even your uncle has been just like your brother

1661
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,850
They are misusing all the Panchayat funds

1662
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:01,440
The accounts you are writing in the society
books are different from the originals

1663
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,940
He said power should change.

1664
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:06,650
Your uncle wished to file nominations
after coming back from Dubai

1665
01:46:06,690 --> 01:46:09,650
I will file nomination in the coming elections
and see what you will do then

1666
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,480
He returned from Dubai

1667
01:47:33,150 --> 01:47:38,480
Your uncle is not in Dubai, they killed him

1668
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:50,350
This is your uncle’s watch
and thus asked you to wear it that day

1669
01:47:51,730 --> 01:47:54,190
Watch is for you, wear it.

1670
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:57,100
Aunty, why didn’t you say?

1671
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:00,270
This Rangamma aunt is a beauty right?

1672
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:04,150
By getting to know that my husband died
every guy from the village feels like a man

1673
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:10,310
All the murders happening in the village
maybe of different types but the reason is the same

1674
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:12,480
To oppose the President...

1675
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,980
Your uncle. Abbulu, Erra Srinu, Venkatrao...

1676
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:21,850
All these didn’t die as their death came but were killed

1677
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:31,060
Say now, will even your brother become like all these?

1678
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:35,770
He killed those all just as they wished to file nominations

1679
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:38,060
Your brother has already filed nominations.

1680
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,560
You think President will stay quiet?

1681
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:58,060
President sir...we know that it is you looting
all our house plots and ruining our crops

1682
01:48:58,190 --> 01:49:02,690
Thus we are competing opposite
you in the elections and standing before you

1683
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,850
I know all this is because of the power.

1684
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:11,600
Those in power are looting in the name of the society,

1685
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:13,770
I will file nominations this time for President post.

1686
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:14,940
Do what you can

1687
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:46,400
Has your brother filed nomination?

1688
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:50,730
He wishes to become a leader? His role too would finish

1689
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:29,560
Say now, should even your brother become so?

1690
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,310
An announcement to the villagers of Rangasthalam

1691
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,690
Grand welcome to our dearest leader, a hope for the
lower and weaker sections and our MLA Dakshinamurthy

1692
01:50:34,730 --> 01:50:37,270
Tie those banners taking a bit high...
You take care of those

1693
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:39,770
Kasi, take care of all these.

1694
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:42,520
There, tie to that pillar

1695
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:49,350
There comes the great leader who arranged food to eat,
clothes to wear and a shelter to live, have a look

1696
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:51,060
Hail to Dakshinamurthy Sir.

1697
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:52,850
Hail to Dakshinamurthy Sir.

1698
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:54,600
Hail to Dakshinamurthy Sir.

1699
01:50:54,650 --> 01:50:58,350
There he comes..Hail to Dakshinamurthy Sir.

1700
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:00,230
Hail to Dakshinamurthy Sir.

1701
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:03,980
Hail to Dakshinamurthy Sir.

1702
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:05,730
Hail to Dakshinamurthy Sir.

1703
01:51:05,810 --> 01:51:08,940
There he comes....Hail to Dakshinamurthy Sir.

1704
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:10,600
Hello sir...
Hello..

1705
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:14,770
Hail to Dakshinamurthy Sir.

1706
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,730
Hello sir..welcome

1707
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:21,190
Hey, go..

1708
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:30,190
Sri Sri says you can’t find a place
without war on this whole globe

1709
01:51:32,270 --> 01:51:34,810
This is not Rangasthalam but a war zone

1710
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:42,020
It’s a fear what may happen,
a fear what happens if we oppose

1711
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:48,190
It’s a fear to be born here, to die here
and a fear even to take breathe

1712
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:56,730
Look man, God decides the death anywhere
but society decides the death in this village

1713
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:04,980
If there is anyone in this village with
no fear of death, raise your hands.

1714
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:09,060
To live in fear is equal to death.

1715
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:16,770
That Lord not just gives a chance to the snake
but even to the ant

1716
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:18,770
You have got that chance now

1717
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:28,350
Our Kumar Babu is the first person filing nomination
opposite to the President in the history of Rangasthalam

1718
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:30,940
He is the courage of this village

1719
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:35,940
Either for the fear in you to be gone
and for your lives to change,

1720
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:40,230
you all should unite and make
Kumar Babu win in the elections

1721
01:52:40,980 --> 01:52:46,440
He is educated, thoughtful person
wishing to do good for the village

1722
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:49,520
All of you should stand as a support to him
Hey, Who are you idiot..?

1723
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:51,980
What is in that bag

1724
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:54,190
Sir..Sir.

1725
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:58,100
Are you mad?

1726
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:00,770
He is get a coffee for me and he is my man

1727
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:02,600
He is your brother, right?

1728
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:03,900
Yes sir..
Why did he hit so?

1729
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:06,310
Maybe he did something wrong

1730
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:08,190
When you fear, what courage would you give the people?

1731
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:10,060
Not that sir..
You come.. move

1732
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,100
Sorry, sir.

1733
01:53:12,190 --> 01:53:13,400
It's okay..no problem.

1734
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:14,100
Not that..

1735
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:16,690
What happened Chittibabu..?
I feared he may harm my brother

1736
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:22,230
No brother, I felt he would be taking out
a knife with his hands

1737
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:24,440
Kasi, now you look into election works.

1738
01:53:24,810 --> 01:53:26,150
We both are different now,

1739
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:27,770
Not that brother..
you heard it?

1740
01:53:36,150 --> 01:53:41,900
Hey babe, see whether it fell beside you or not...
My necklace chain...

1741
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:45,810
Hey babe, see whether it fell beside you or not...

1742
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:49,980
Hey, where is your brother? Hey, did you listen?

1743
01:53:50,020 --> 01:53:53,060
Have you cooked anything for me or again it is for him?

1744
01:53:53,190 --> 01:53:55,350
I thought, it is your deed

1745
01:53:55,730 --> 01:53:57,940
Here, you always come together right?

1746
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:02,060
He is a big President and will have many obligations.

1747
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:03,940
Who cares where he goes? What if he doesn't leave?

1748
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:05,690
He does his work and I do mine

1749
01:54:05,730 --> 01:54:07,440
Oh that is the issue..!

1750
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:08,850
Mine is the necklace

1751
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:13,150
Hello go first to the house of Kasi and see.
He would be in discussion there

1752
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:14,100
Okay.

1753
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,900
No peace from when these elections have come
Hey Kitti

1754
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:19,980
Have you seen my elder one?

1755
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:26,230
We know where this tall idiot goes, poor lady doesn’t know

1756
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:34,850
Oh God, this head ache is killing.
I should never drink again, my God

1757
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:39,730
Boss is right here,
you have all been over me for the whole night

1758
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:44,440
Village works in the morning
and works with someone at city in the night

1759
01:54:44,980 --> 01:54:48,060
Sir is now the President candidate

1760
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:48,730
See you brother

1761
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:50,190
Where can we get him now?

1762
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:52,940
Hey Chitti
If he is so now, in future...

1763
01:54:52,980 --> 01:54:53,810
Careful dear

1764
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:57,190
Boss, all ward members are going
to take back their nominations

1765
01:54:57,650 --> 01:55:00,690
One bad thing is gone now,
we have the engine works. Move

1766
01:55:00,730 --> 01:55:03,520
We just spoke to them yesterday right?
don't know sir, they are going getting into the tractor

1767
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:04,650
Move...

1768
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:09,980
What exactly happened?
No idea sir

1769
01:55:16,650 --> 01:55:17,480
What happened Kasi?

1770
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:20,980
What’s there, we are going to take back the nominations

1771
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:22,230
I am asking, why is that?

1772
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:24,100
All are aware in the village, dude

1773
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:26,310
You don’t have to play a drama before us

1774
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,440
I am asking what that drama is?

1775
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:31,520
Both brothers have cheated us greatly

1776
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:33,190
I will understand what happened only
when you say, right?

1777
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:38,400
Nothing Kumar, Whole village is talking that
your brother is taken money from the President

1778
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:42,310
Understood right? Come on start the vehicle
Hey, wait

1779
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:45,150
Don’t get excited without knowing the truth.
You too come along with me

1780
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:46,850
I will question Chittibabu in front of you.

1781
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:50,650
If my brother has really done the mistake,
I too will come along with you

1782
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:52,310
I will withdraw my nomination

1783
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:54,850
Go man, should we come with you?
Come on..I will say to you..

1784
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:57,150
Wait guys, come on let us go

1785
01:55:57,310 --> 01:56:01,190
Mom, serve me the food and put into the chilli too

1786
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:01,850
Hey Chitti...

1787
01:56:03,730 --> 01:56:05,100
Did you take money from that President?

1788
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:10,100
Hey, I am asking you
This tall rascal has messed with me early in the morning

1789
01:56:10,270 --> 01:56:11,100
Why will I take?

1790
01:56:12,650 --> 01:56:13,690
Mom, give that food here

1791
01:56:13,730 --> 01:56:15,600
Hey, why don’t you answer when brother is asking?

1792
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,480
How many times should I tell? Can’t you listen?

1793
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:21,230
What is he becoming the President, I am dying with him

1794
01:56:21,650 --> 01:56:23,850
Chitti, look into my eyes and say.

1795
01:56:24,230 --> 01:56:25,350
Have you taken money or not?

1796
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:27,400
Why do you say so? Why will he take?

1797
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:28,600
Mom..give onion to me

1798
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:33,600
You will not answer so, idiot
Hey, stop

1799
01:56:33,650 --> 01:56:36,400
Stop brother, listen to me.
Stop Kumar babu,

1800
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:37,980
Hey Kumar...wait.
You wait

1801
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:39,400
did you take money or not?

1802
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,310
Brother, stop and listen to me

1803
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:43,020
Wait, my throat will get cut
Hey, what is this?

1804
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:45,230
hey, I will tell you later. Leave it..listen to me
Answer to what I asked,

1805
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:46,350
you have taken or not?

1806
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:47,100
I will tell you later.

1807
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:48,520
Hey, listen to me..

1808
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:49,480
Say, you took or not?

1809
01:56:49,650 --> 01:56:51,440
Hey, I have taken. I took

1810
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:53,690
Yes, I took

1811
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:54,690
I took

1812
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:56,980
Blood.

1813
01:56:58,730 --> 01:57:02,100
Mom, apply the turmeric
Village is just believing us

1814
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:05,020
You have made all together into idiots

1815
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:08,810
He is bleeding, go and get turmeric.

1816
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:10,440
Go and bring turmeric

1817
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:13,350
What if he lives, you have killed him

1818
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:16,600
Not that Mom

1819
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:21,150
Not that dad, I feared something may happen to brother
Hey, get out of the house

1820
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:23,440
What Dad?

1821
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:27,230
Deaf rascal, get out of the house

1822
01:57:57,190 --> 01:58:07,190
Chants..

1823
01:58:08,150 --> 01:58:23,520
(Worshipping to the Goddess)

1824
01:58:44,230 --> 01:58:47,060
President sir, here is your money

1825
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:52,730
I don’t know how much was in this.

1826
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:55,020
Still, no differences would come

1827
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:58,810
Not to come, I have buried right there

1828
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:05,690
Still, I thought ward members would
go back if I take this money

1829
01:59:05,730 --> 01:59:07,600
and that my brother will take back his nomination

1830
01:59:07,850 --> 01:59:11,940
Still what is that fellow Sir?
He put the knife to throat and said he will kill himself...

1831
01:59:12,650 --> 01:59:15,850
I died watching that Sir.

1832
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:18,400
I don't need this money.

1833
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:24,940
Still, I feel very proud seeing my brother.

1834
01:59:25,650 --> 01:59:27,310
He is doing so much for the village

1835
01:59:27,650 --> 01:59:30,480
How much more should I do for such a guy?

1836
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:33,310
I will do sir, I will do

1837
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:34,940
I will do for sure Sir

1838
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,850
Yes, I forgot.

1839
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:43,600
Whole village is saying that President Sir
does so many worships and he has great powers

1840
01:59:43,770 --> 01:59:48,440
and those powers will kill if anybody opposes him

1841
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:53,810
I mean those people, that Abbulu, Venkatrao, Erra Srinu...

1842
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:56,940
They say all these died the same way

1843
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:57,850
President sir...

1844
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:03,650
You should know if they are true or not.
You are a great man

1845
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:12,350
If that is really true by chance, say a word to your powers

1846
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:17,350
There is a brother named Chittibabu to Kumar Babu.

1847
02:00:18,150 --> 02:00:23,270
To touch him, say that you got to cross
the guts of this Chittibabu

1848
02:00:26,230 --> 02:00:28,770
Also say you cannot go crossing, ok?

1849
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:34,810
Hey, Sir heard what all I said.
Come on beat it now

1850
02:00:41,730 --> 02:00:42,650
See you sir.

1851
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:44,730
Hey, Chittibabu... who would clean the glass?

1852
02:01:05,060 --> 02:01:06,020
Sister, you bless

1853
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:07,600
Hey..move.

1854
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:09,900
Wow...What uncle?

1855
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:13,230
They have made Ramalakshmi into the bride

1856
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:14,230
Hey Chittibabu... why are you here..?

1857
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:15,350
So..beautiful..

1858
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:15,850
Get out.

1859
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:16,440
Hey....

1860
02:01:17,810 --> 02:01:18,350
Catch it..

1861
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:23,600
Hey Ramalakshmi, you look cute in this bridal attire

1862
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:28,020
Will any idiot let go such a cute girl?

1863
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:31,020
This Chittibabu is letting her go.

1864
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:32,020
Get out

1865
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:36,730
Even after saying so many times
to this Chittibabu that I want this Ramalakshmi,

1866
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:38,850
these ears are not listening

1867
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:40,770
Hey Ramalakshmi, you know what?

1868
02:01:42,230 --> 02:01:45,940
I like you, but I like my brother more than you

1869
02:01:51,730 --> 02:01:52,600
What am I to do?

1870
02:01:53,350 --> 02:01:54,730
You know why am I crying even now?

1871
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:57,150
Not because you are ready for the marriage.

1872
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:01,440
My brother at home, he put the knife to throat
and said he will kill himself...

1873
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:03,190
I am getting to cry remembering that

1874
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:07,310
But I have just one pain.

1875
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:11,600
I left everything for my brother. I left you too

1876
02:02:13,230 --> 02:02:15,400
And can you not let go your father for me?

1877
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,440
I am saying now.

1878
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:24,980
when you have as much
love on me as I have on my brother, that day you tell me.

1879
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:28,690
I will not leave anyone.

1880
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:32,850
I will come myself, take you and marry you

1881
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:37,060
Move...

1882
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:40,690
Stop crying.

1883
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:44,980
If this marriage stops, your father
would this time really die consuming this poison

1884
02:02:57,650 --> 02:03:00,480
You’ll not die with the small tin, have the big can and die

1885
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:13,810
What are those papers?

1886
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:15,190
Voter list it seems Sir

1887
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:18,980
We were unanimous all these days and thus we never saw it

1888
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,730
Scrutiny is done and it seems
we shall get ready for the elections

1889
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:26,440
Huh, politics have changed in Rangasthalam.

1890
02:03:26,770 --> 02:03:29,400
It looks like a new President may be coming for the village

1891
02:03:29,690 --> 02:03:34,520
We killed all those Venkatrao, Abbulu,
Rangamma’s husband

1892
02:03:34,730 --> 02:03:38,940
and even Erra Srinu son of our servant
Edukonadalu who opposed us till date

1893
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:43,770
But we erred in the case of that Kumar fellow being quiet

1894
02:03:44,850 --> 02:03:46,690
Why do you cry?

1895
02:03:47,230 --> 02:03:51,810
Even that God is like us, he keeps taking the right guy

1896
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:56,810
I could not know that you are that God sir,
I could not know

1897
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:59,190
I could not know

1898
02:04:07,310 --> 02:04:09,480
I am sorry Sir, I did not notice

1899
02:04:09,850 --> 02:04:13,770
Still what can we do now Sir,
whole village is on the side of Kumar babu

1900
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:16,270
Added is the support of Dakshinamurthy.

1901
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:19,480
A day to call you by name has come Sir

1902
02:04:19,650 --> 02:04:23,600
My advice is its better to quit than to lose

1903
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:28,690
Oh no, it was a mistake sir

1904
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:30,400
Sir, it was a mistake sir

1905
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:32,480
What rascal?
I am sorry sir

1906
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:02,650
They don’t come even the bell is rung.
Are they too deaf like me

1907
02:05:03,650 --> 02:05:07,060
Hey Govindulu, we returned President’s money

1908
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:09,770
You know? Yes, you would be aware

1909
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:13,600
Whole village knows it, but those at the house don’t know

1910
02:05:14,150 --> 02:05:15,600
The tall rascal heard it

1911
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:18,350
Hey, stop these over actions and come in

1912
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:20,600
Why will I come in? You think I have no ego?

1913
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:21,600
Mom..chitti has come

1914
02:05:21,770 --> 02:05:22,520
No worries if someone said

1915
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:25,730
but own father said deaf rascal and asked to get out

1916
02:05:26,230 --> 02:05:28,060
In addition he scolded loud like I can listen

1917
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,850
You know how much sad did I feel?

1918
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:33,270
Stop the over actions, come and eat

1919
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:37,400
Hello Kanthamma madam, my hunger died
long back for what your husband said me

02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,230

Oh my dear..

2139

I fed you milk with this hand
and gave you food with this hand

2140
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:57,060
I gave you head bath with this hand
and massaged your legs with this hand

2141
02:27:57,190 --> 02:28:00,730

Shall I carry your corpse with the same hands?

2148
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:39,310
Shall I light your pier with this hand?

2149
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:19,600
Are the legs showing us paths are into the burning wood?

2150
02:29:20,690 --> 02:29:25,650
Will the hands patting on our
shoulders turning into ashes?

2151
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:31,100
Are the eyes dreaming for us burnt and become black?

2152
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:37,310
Has the voice waking us up gone into deep sleep?

2153
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:44,480
You were a support to console when we were in troubles

2154
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:49,730
It would have been nice if you were there
to console our present grief now

2157
02:30:02,850 --> 02:30:09,060
I drove away the evil sight with this hand
and I consoled you with this hand

2158
02:30:09,190 --> 02:30:14,980
I taught you to walk with this hand
and sent you to school with this hand

2159
02:30:15,020 --> 02:30:19,400
Shall I send you to graveyard with this same hand?

2160
02:30:20,940 --> 02:30:24,940
Should I send you to be burnt with this same hand?

2161
02:30:26,900 --> 02:30:31,600
Oh my dear..

2162
02:30:32,940 --> 02:30:37,650
Oh my dear..

2163
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:07,940
Brother is weeping for you

2164
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:14,270
Sister is drowned into tears for you

2165
02:31:15,350 --> 02:31:20,440
food in the plate is searching for you

2166
02:31:20,850 --> 02:31:26,520
Your spectacles are looking around for you

2167
02:31:27,270 --> 02:31:33,520
The shirt you wore is in pain
and has committed suicide to the hanger

2168
02:31:36,190 --> 02:31:47,190
Has your role ended in Rangasthalam?

2169
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:52,770
Has the emptied role started in the graveyard?

2170
02:31:53,850 --> 02:31:59,730
Have the claps of tears rolled for your action?

2171
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:10,560
Maybe you have bid a good bye to us
But our sinful ears could not listen to that

2172
02:32:12,230 --> 02:32:16,940
Oh my dear..

2173
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:21,440
Chittibabu..it seems President is escaping in the Launch

2174
02:32:24,350 --> 02:32:27,810

Oh my dear..

2176
02:32:36,690 --> 02:32:41,650
On the north side to the village at the big tree,
black smokes would come...

2177
02:32:44,730 --> 02:32:48,520
Vengama Sattayya, you say the route

2180
02:32:56,020 --> 02:32:57,980
I am a deaf rascal

2181
02:33:01,230 --> 02:33:04,600
You are searching for the snake.
Human would be with a head

2182
02:33:12,810 --> 02:33:15,900
Careful, he is ready to hiss

2183
02:33:20,190 --> 02:33:22,270
Careful, he is on the North side

2184
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:36,480
Careful, he is watching your way on the South side

2185
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:41,850
He is breathing in the grass bushes,
foxes are safeguarding him

2186
02:33:58,060 --> 02:34:01,150
Excuse me, how do we go to Achanta Venkatrao’s house?

2187
02:34:04,650 --> 02:34:06,690
Say a bit loud, I cannot listen

2188
02:34:06,850 --> 02:34:09,230
How do we go to Achanta Venkatrao’s house?

2189
02:34:09,350 --> 02:34:11,480
Fourth lane going a bit ahead

2190

Have you made everything ready?

2230
02:37:45,850 --> 02:37:46,730
What dude, what is this?

2231
02:37:47,020 --> 02:37:49,270
How long would you be right here? Come back to home

2232
02:37:50,850 --> 02:37:54,980
Mother in law is worried a lot about Chittibabu,
she is not eating food properly

2233
02:37:55,850 --> 02:37:56,770
Why not come, son?

2234
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:01,560
Will I not feel like coming back? Let me be right here

2235
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:03,810
Ok, how is sister?

2236
02:38:06,400 --> 02:38:06,980
Come dear

2237
02:38:25,770 --> 02:38:28,810
Careful dear, study well as said by brother

2238
02:38:30,690 --> 02:38:32,940
Dad, see you
See you.

2239
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:04,560
Doctor Sir...

2240
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:11,190
Doctor Sir... he Opened his eyes.

2241
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:15,060
Murthy sir.

2242
02:39:15,980 --> 02:39:16,940
Dakshinamurthy Sir,

2243
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:20,350
It’s me Dr. Seetharam.

2244
02:39:20,440 --> 02:39:21,810
Have you recognized me?

2245
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:31,520
Dakshinamurthy Sir

2246
02:39:33,350 --> 02:39:35,350
Hubby, look here...

2247
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:36,230
Dad...

2248
02:39:37,150 --> 02:39:37,650
Dad...

2249
02:39:38,850 --> 02:39:40,980
Dear husband..

2250
02:39:44,150 --> 02:39:44,810
Dear husband..

02:39:45,730 --> 02:39:48,350
It's me...Please do look at me.

2252
02:40:27,980 --> 02:40:28,650
Chittibabu

2253
02:40:31,730 --> 02:40:34,810
Chittibabu, it is all because of you

2254
02:40:35,650 --> 02:40:37,020
Your confidence has saved him

2255
02:40:37,690 --> 02:40:39,810
You have really done a war for his life

2256
02:40:40,350 --> 02:40:44,440
Just two months more and
he will stand up and walk around

2257
02:40:44,690 --> 02:40:46,150
Okay, see you sir.

2258
02:40:49,730 --> 02:40:52,600
After two months...

2259
02:41:04,850 --> 02:41:05,650
Come on..get up.

2260
02:41:05,690 --> 02:41:07,100
Hail to Minister Sir.

2266
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:23,940

Hey prepare the food, all our people are arriving..

02:41:30,350 --> 02:41:30,770
Okay..?

2270
02:41:30,980 --> 02:41:33,730
Hey Venkanna, arrangements of food
are to be seen there. Come fast

2271
02:41:33,770 --> 02:41:34,350
Madam

2272
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:36,350
Chittibabu, what are you here?
Hello madam

2273
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:39,060
I need to talk to sir once..
Then why are you here? Come inside

2274
02:41:39,350 --> 02:41:39,980

2275
02:41:46,270 --> 02:41:49,480
He’s upstairs Chittibabu, go
Hey, take proper care of all, go

2276
02:41:51,810 --> 02:41:53,190
Hey, take out all these

02:41:54,520 --> 02:41:55,020
Hello sir..

2278
02:41:55,060 --> 02:41:57,730
Hey, Chittibabu, how are you..?

2279
02:41:57,940 --> 02:41:59,190
I am fine sir, how are you..?

2280
02:41:59,230 --> 02:42:00,850
I’m very fine,

2281
02:42:00,940 --> 02:42:04,480
you know right..?he is served me for two years.
He never lets go anything

2282
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:04,940
Hello..

2283
02:42:05,060 --> 02:42:07,520
I have no death and live for hundred years

2284
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:08,350
Good sir..
Come on sit.

2285
02:42:08,770 --> 02:42:13,150
I just got the call from high command
and my name is in the list it seems

2286
02:42:13,480 --> 02:42:17,150
It is all because of you
and I am drinking in that same happiness

2287
02:42:17,650 --> 02:42:21,730
Say, what can I do and what do you need?

2288
02:42:22,230 --> 02:42:24,100
Sir, I need to talk something with you

2289
02:42:24,350 --> 02:42:27,480
My life is yours, Come on what?

2290
02:42:28,270 --> 02:42:28,810
Sir.

2291
02:42:30,980 --> 02:42:32,020
You please be outside sir

2292
02:42:33,650 --> 02:42:35,400
Hey, close the doors.

2293
02:42:36,980 --> 02:42:37,690
Close the door

2294
02:42:38,150 --> 02:42:40,650
Yes, say

2295
02:42:41,150 --> 02:42:48,150
Sir, your health should be fine and thus prayed
to our Goddess Gangamma.

2296
02:42:48,650 --> 02:42:50,560
Have this offering

2297
02:42:51,770 --> 02:42:55,400
What dude, why so much affection on me?

2298
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:58,560
Oh, how is your village?

2299
02:42:58,650 --> 02:42:59,560
Very good sir

2300
02:42:59,650 --> 02:43:02,230
As my brother longed for... Village is very good Sir

2301
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:06,400
I heard what all happened to you and felt very bad.

2302
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:10,810
Was that President found?

2303
02:43:12,440 --> 02:43:17,270
We searched a lot, we searched everywhere
but he was not found

2304
02:43:18,230 --> 02:43:19,230
We had foreseen that now...

2305
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:22,520
We started now to kill that fellow with
the symbols as she said

2306
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:24,770
On the north side to the village at the big tree,
black smokes would come...

2307
02:43:24,810 --> 02:43:26,060
he is on the North side

2308
02:43:26,150 --> 02:43:29,020
he is watching your way on the South side
He is breathing in the grass bushes,

2309
02:43:29,060 --> 02:43:31,060
foxes are safeguarding him

2310
02:45:24,480 --> 02:45:26,190
I killed him...
Have you killed?

2311
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:28,100
Yes..sir!

2312
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:34,230
Erra Srinu, Abbulu, Venkatrao and finally husband
of Rangamma aunt who takes great care of me...

2313
02:45:34,810 --> 02:45:38,060
The guy killing so many...
It’s justified to kill such a guy, right Sir?

2314
02:45:42,850 --> 02:45:43,520
It is justified...

2315
02:45:45,150 --> 02:45:45,980
He has to be killed

2316
02:45:47,980 --> 02:45:54,020
But you killing my brother is not justified sir

2317
02:45:57,900 --> 02:46:02,980
Hey, what are you saying?
Why should I be killing your brother?

2318
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:09,560
Yes sir, I too did not understand
why you had to kill my brother

2319
02:46:10,350 --> 02:46:14,150
He said something while dying Sir

2320
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:20,190
Srimannarayana...

2321
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:24,810
I am a deaf rascal and cannot listen to properly

2322
02:46:25,650 --> 02:46:27,650
I never was worried as I cannot listen, Sir.

2323
02:46:28,730 --> 02:46:34,810
For the first time, I felt very bad thinking
why God has given me this deficiency

2324
02:46:35,940 --> 02:46:40,270
But that same God has shown another way out

2325
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:49,270
The song played in celebration and
what my brother said before dying was the same

2326
02:46:49,350 --> 02:46:50,980
Srimannarayana...

2327
02:46:51,690 --> 02:46:53,520
Srimannarayana...

2328
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:55,690
Srimannarayana...

2329
02:46:56,690 --> 02:46:58,560
Srimannarayana...

2330
02:46:59,650 --> 02:47:00,900
Srimannarayana...

2331
02:47:01,480 --> 02:47:07,190
Srimannarayana...

2332
02:47:11,980 --> 02:47:15,770
Luckily, there is no Srimannarayana in our village Sir

2333
02:47:16,690 --> 02:47:21,520
We are all the children of mother Ganges Sir!
But, I heard that name somewhere

2334
02:47:22,600 --> 02:47:29,810
It is tough to put words into Chittibabu's ears.
but once it goes in, it stays stamped there

2335
02:47:30,730 --> 02:47:35,770
Yes for once, I heard that from you Sir

2336
02:47:38,770 --> 02:47:41,020
Hey Srimannarayana
Chitti

2337
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:43,440
My man and brought coffee for me

2338
02:47:46,350 --> 02:47:51,350
Srimannarayana is your man

2339
02:47:55,190 --> 02:47:58,350
He said it all before dying

2340
02:47:58,940 --> 02:48:03,020
Why did you kill my brother? Who asked you to kill, say

2341
02:48:03,560 --> 02:48:05,150
Who asked you to kill, say

2342
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:08,350
Dakshinamurthy...
your brother loved the younger daughter of him

2343
02:48:08,440 --> 02:48:11,850
It seems my brother was in love with
your younger daughter, right?

2344
02:48:13,730 --> 02:48:14,850
I will be to the hostel dad...

2345
02:48:15,850 --> 02:48:16,520
Here..

2346
02:48:17,810 --> 02:48:19,480
Come home at least this Saturday
Okay.

2347
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:30,230
Will you kill when someone loves Sir?

2348
02:48:30,730 --> 02:48:32,600
Srimannarayana...

2349
02:48:43,980 --> 02:48:45,440
It is so horrible sir.

2350
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:48,770
You gave a bail to me with no relation

2351
02:48:49,400 --> 02:48:53,100
You made my brother file nomination,
got him killed and pushed into the account of President

2352
02:48:55,270 --> 02:48:57,690
You took a full life Sir

2353
02:49:03,060 --> 02:49:07,350
Will anyone stay quiet instead of killing?
you bloody rascals.

2354
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:15,100
Your brother is not qualified even to step into my house
and how can he think of stepping into my daughter’s bedroom?

2355
02:49:15,270 --> 02:49:16,980
What are you and what’s your life?

2356
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:22,560
Now you are talking correct Sir, this is your real face

2357
02:49:22,600 --> 02:49:25,650
Yes rascal! Can you hear, you deaf idiot

2358
02:49:26,270 --> 02:49:28,520
Why did you save after knowing that I killed?

2359
02:49:29,350 --> 02:49:36,440
I thought to kill you as and when I came to know sir,
but Lorry hit you by then

2360
02:49:37,980 --> 02:49:41,150
I took you fighting death to the hospital.

2361
02:49:42,100 --> 02:49:43,770
I served you a lot sir.

2362
02:49:44,440 --> 02:49:50,560
I changed you dress, washed your clothes
and even cleaned your toilet

2363
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:55,900
My hand while shaving your beard shook

2364
02:49:59,770 --> 02:50:01,350
Shivering... Like this..

2365
02:50:02,560 --> 02:50:07,440
I thought to kill you right then sir,
but you know why I kept you alive Sir?

2366
02:50:08,350 --> 02:50:10,980
You should know how painful it is when your dying

2367
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:13,650
and before that you should understand
all my pain that i have undergone.

2368
02:50:14,230 --> 02:50:15,480
My brother told me Sir.

2369
02:50:16,190 --> 02:50:21,150
Even the criminal given a hanging sentence
will not be hung if he has even a small fever

2370
02:50:21,850 --> 02:50:27,850
He should be healthy and
he being healthy should have hopes to live

2371
02:50:27,900 --> 02:50:28,730
Hey..

2372
02:50:29,650 --> 02:50:31,350
see sir..now you see

2373
02:50:32,150 --> 02:50:35,940
Look Sir, you are so greedy.
Added you wish to become even a Minister now

2374
02:50:37,350 --> 02:50:39,810
It is justified to kill now, right Sir?

2375
02:50:40,350 --> 02:50:41,730
Just wait...

2376
02:50:44,810 --> 02:50:45,850
Do you remember him.

2377
02:50:48,190 --> 02:50:49,230
My Brother.

2378
02:50:49,850 --> 02:50:54,060
For killing my brother Chelluboina Kumar Babu
of Rangasthalam village,

2379
02:50:54,690 --> 02:50:59,020
and his brother Chelluboina Chittibabu will kill you.

2380
02:51:00,520 --> 02:51:01,850
Now you understood sir.

2381
02:51:05,650 --> 02:51:08,650
You understood well now sir
